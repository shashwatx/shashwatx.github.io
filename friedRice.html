Another great way to use the cauliflower “rice”: make chinese fried rice! It was a huge hit with my guests :)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>, <em>serves 4-5</em>
    <ul>
      <li>1 processed cauliflower, like you can see <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">here</a></li>
      <li>200-300 g shrimp (I buy frozen raw shrimp and thaw )</li>
      <li>150 g boiled green peas (mine were canned)</li>
      <li>2 cubed carrots</li>
      <li>2-3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste (1-2 cloves)</li>
      <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
      <li>Spring onion to garnish</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pan with a tablespoon of oil, add the garlic and ginger. After cooking for a minute, add the carrots with a bit of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the carrot is slightly soft. Turn up the heat and add the shrimp.</li>
      <li>Cook the shrimp for a couple of minutes and then add the green peas. Cook for one minute.</li>
      <li>Add the processed cauliflower, soy sauce, stir very well and cook for a couple of minutes until the cauliflower is soft. Check salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Garnish with spring onion.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

Ever since I was a kid, my mom would make lamb or fish "en cuajadera": roasted with white wine, potatos and vegetables. By omitting the potatoes, this is a delicious and complete meal, perfect for a ketogenic diet. 

<ul>
  <li>One Leg of lamb (if boneless should be 450 g meat)</li>
  <li>1 medium zucchini, sliced (180g)</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, sliced (110g)</li>
  <li>1 cup of chopped tomato (150 g)</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
  <li>150 mL of dry white wine</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>A handful of parsley</li>
  <li>Salt, ground black pepper, dry thyme</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
  2. Chop the vegetables. Place on a greased baking tray. Then put the lamb on top and add the rest of the ingredients.   
  3. Bake for about 90 minutes (depending on the size of the lamb piece), turning it around after half the time, until the meat is tender.

This is such an easy recipe I wasn't even sure if I should upload it! These wraps take about 5 minutes to put together and are incredibly tasty. You can add other ingredients to taste, such as chopped pickles, or you could add 50 g of cooked chopped prawns to have a serving of 30 g of protein.  


<ul>
  <li>3 collard greens, stem removed (50g)</li>
  <li>55 g tinned tuna (in brine) (solids only)</li>
  <li>One boiled egg</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise (30g)</li>
  <li>1/4 avocado (50 g)</li>
  <li>7 green olives, chopped</li>
  <li>Optional: black pepper, ground chili</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Prepare the collard greens by removing the stem. You can chop it off altogether, or you can put the leaf on a chopping board and then trim the stem horizontally like you would when making [cabbage rolls](http://maria.recipes/ketoCabbageRolls). 
  2. Mash the avocado with a fork, then mix all the ingredients for the filling. Divide into three. 
  3. Put one part of the filling into the edge of the collard leaf, then wrap as if you were making [cabbage rolls](http://maria.recipes/ketoCabbageRolls). You can secure the wraps with toothpicks if you want to have them on the go.

  <li>1/2 cup shredded purple cabbage (35 g)</li>
  <li>125 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt (or more to taste)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black salt (kala namak) (sub for regular salt if not available)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/4 garlic clove (or less, to taste)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tahini</li>
  <li>Stevia or other sweetener to taste</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp water</li>
  <li>Spicy Paprika, Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the cubed tofu with the black salt and some black pepper, and fry for 10-15 minutes until it is golden and slightly crunchy.
  2. Meanwhile, chop the cabbabe.
  3. Mix all the other ingredients except the paprika to make the dressing. If you aren’t a big garlic fan, leave it in a big chunk and let it infuse, then take out before eating.
  4. Add half of the dressing to the cabbage and mix well to cover it.
  5. Once the tofu is done, serve on top of the cabbage, add the rest of the dressing and some paprika, and serve while it is still warm.

Soy is almost unavoidable in a vegetarian diet, especially for lowcarbers. But a lot of people are alergic, others are intolerant, and other people like me don't want to base all their nourishment on a single ingredient...

But here comes Chickpea Tofu to the rescue!

The original recipe is from Birmania: a tofu made from chickpea flour that is served as is in salads. I modified it a bit, reducing the amount of chickpea flour and incorporating some flax and protein powder to make it lower carb and higher protein. 

The result are tofu cubes with a very delicate flavor and texture, that can be sauteed in oil, which makes them slightly crunchy on the outside but still pillowy in the inside. A real delicacy!

My favorite way of having them is sauteed with coconut oil and spices, served warm over salad with some fresh coriander. Yum.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) chickpea flour</li>
  <li>50g flavor free protein powder (like <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">unflavored whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (50g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>1/2-2/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/4-1/3 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients. Then add one cup of the water and mix until you have a batter/paste. 
  2. Take the rest of the water to a boil. When it starts boiling, gently add in the batter while whisking. 
  3. Keep simmering while whisking for about 8 minutes, until it is as thick as clay. You can whisk in the beginning, then switch to a spatula when it gets thicker. 
  4. Pour in a lightly greased mold and let it cool down in the fridge for at least one hour.

When people think of indian food, they very rarely think of fish dishes, but in certain parts of the country like Bengal or Mumbai, fish curries are a staple in every household. This one in particular is my favorite, as the coconut milk makes for a super creamy sauce.

<ul>
  <li>500 g cod or other similar fish, cut in chunks</li>
  <li>3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 dried red chili (or one green chili chopped to be added with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
  <li>1/2 medium onion (50 g)</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (150 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garlic paste or 4 cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>3/4 cups coconut milk</li>
  <li>Optional: 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander to garnish</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil in a pan over medium high heat. Fry the mustard seeds and dried red chili.
  2. When the seeds start to pop, wait about one minute, then add the garlic, ginger and onions with a bit of salt. Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes until they are translucent.
  3. Add the chopped tomatoes with salt. Cook for 5 minutes until they break down. 
  4. Add the fish with the rest of the salt. 
  5. Turn up the stove to high heat to cook the fish for about 2 minutes. Add the spices. Mix and cook for 30 seconds, then add the coconut milk.
  6. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Turn off the stove, add vinegar or lemon juice, garnish with coriander and serve.

This pizza base is seriously awesome. I used [this recipe](http://www.meatfreeketo.com/vegan-fathead-pizza-crust/) but omitted the vegan cheese and used some nutritional yeast instead to get some cheesy flavor. Seriously: this pizza holds its shape perfectly, is chewy and salty and delicious, vegan, and only 3.1 g net carbs for half a pizza crust!


<ul>
  <li>85 g of <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground (1/2 cup + 1.5 tbsp)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>(32 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp (6 g) nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water</li>
  <li>For Margharita Pizzaa: 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 cup (110 g) shredded mozzarella (you can use vegan mozzarella, but it will change the macros), 1/2 cup tomato passata, some dried oregano, fresh basil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  2. In a bowl, mix everything except the water. Then add the water little by little until you form a dough.
  3. Put the dough on a parchment paper, put another paper on top and then spread it out with a rolling pin until it is 2-3 mm thick. Once it is even, cut it out to whichever shape you want (I used a big lid to make it round). If it cracks, use your finger with a little bit of water to smooth it out. 
  4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until it's slightly dry and golden.
  5. Put whichever toppings you want and then bake for another 5-10 minutes.

This is the indian version of scrambled tofu: crumbled paneer with vegetables and spices. A very filling meal full of protein that takes 10 minutes from start to finish. A must try!

<ul>
  <li>250 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium), chopped</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (100g), chopped</li>
  <li>Other vegetables to taste (like green peas), optional</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/4 tsp whole cumin</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp garam masala or more to taste</li> 
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>  
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, if the crumbled paneer is too dry, add a little bit of warm water to rehydrate it.
  2. Melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds until they start popping. Then, add the onion with some salt and cook for 5 minutes until they are brown.
  3. Once the onion is cooked, add the ginger and garlic. Cook for a minute. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and salt. Cook for two minutes until they the tomatoes are soft, then add the other spices. Mix well. 
  5. Add the paneer (drained if you were soaking it). Cook for 30-60 seconds. Add the kasuri methi if you are using it.
  6. Garnish with lemon juice and coriander.

I love sautéed tofu; it gets very chewy and crunchy, and when mixed with spices it can be delicious.

<ul>
  <li>2 cups (250 g) firm tofu, cubed OR 200 g paneer (if using paneer, omit mayonnaise)</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>4 cups of fresh spinach (120g) OR 4 cups shredded lettuce (180g)</li> 
  <li>1 cup of fresh cucumber (130g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup of fresh red bell pepper (75g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise OR 3/4 extra tbsp coconut oil and 3/4 extra tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>Optional: Chaat masala, to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non-stick pan, melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Then add the tofu and all the spices along with 1/2 tbsp lemon juice. Sautée for 15-20 minutes until it is very golden and firm.
  2. Mix all the other ingredients and serve while the tofu is still warm. If you are making this ahead of time, keep the tofu in a separate container and warm up before eating.

Paneer is indian cottage cheese, one of the basic protein sources for vegetarian curries. You can use it in blocks in tikka or gravies, or you can crumble it for egg-free hash browns or bhurji. 

The nutritional info may not be 100% accurate as I estimated using packaged paneer. The more it is drained, the lower carb it will be.

<ul>
  <li>2 L (8 cups) whole fat milk</li>
  <li>1/4 cup lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy bottom saucepan.
  2. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice, stirring constantly until it curdles and the whey has separated completely.
  3. Using a very fine sieve or a cheese cloth, separate the curds from the whey. You can keep the whey for something different (it has some protein, but also carbs, so not keto-friendly!). 
  4. Drain the curd well and use it fresh, or put it with some weight on top to form a firm block.

Easiest recipe for a delicious Chicken Curry. It won't be as good as the recipes that use real indian spices and blends... but it is pretty darn good anyway :) 

<ul>
  <li>8 chicken drumsticks, with skin and bone (1 kg)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/2 big onion or one medium (110g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or one big clove of garlic</li>
  <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
  <li>1 cup of coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/4-1 cup of water depending on desired sauce</li>
  <li><i>Optional:coriander to garnish</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. In a pot or a pressure cooker, in two batches, sear the meat (with some salt) for about 3 minutes, using 1 tbsp oil per batch. Set the seared drumsticks aside. 
  2. Purée the onion, ginger and garlic. 
  3. Heat up the other 2 tbsp oil and fry the onion paste, with salt and pepper, over medium heat for about 10 minutes until it smells sweet. 
  4. Add the curry powder. Cook for 60 seconds, then add the coconut milk and water (add water depending on how thick you want your sauce; add more water if you will be cooking on an open pot). Mix well until the sauce is even. 
  5. When it comes to a boil, add the chicken back in. Now cook on an open flame on low heat for about 45-60 minutes or in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes until the meat is tender. 
  6. Garnish with coriander and serve.

This recipe for burger patties using mung beans is a great way to get some legumes in your diet. Mung beans (green soy) have a very nice flavor, and if you let them sprout, the carb count will be lower and they will have more protein. On top of that, you can add any spices you want to get different styles.  

It is hard to know the exact nutritional information for this recipe as it depends on how long the beans sprout for; I estimated the data sprouting them for 3 or 4 days.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (100g) mung beans (green soy)</li>
  <li>Optional: 30 g unflavored protein powder (such as <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> or butter or ghee</li>
  <li>Other spices to taste</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Let the beans sprout for 3 or 4 days until they have roots of 1-2 cm. 
  2. Blend all the ingredients until you have a thick paste. 
  3. Divide into four and form patties using your hands.  
  4. Fry each patty with 1/2 tbsp oil until it is golden on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).

A great recipe for all those vegan ketoers, or anyone who cannot eat eggs but still wants to eat some french amazingness. You can adapt this basic recipe to your taste, changing the vegetables and/or adding other ingredients, such as cheese or meat! 


<ul>
  <li> 1 <a href="http://maria.recipes/ketoCrust">low-carb crust</a> </li>
  <li> 1.5 cups of chopped zucchini (180-200 g, one medium) </li>
  <li> One leek (80g) </li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li> 400 g firm tofu</li>
  <li> 3-4 tbsp water</li>
  <li> 1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li> Black pepper to taste</li>
  <li> <i>Optional: 3 tbsp nutritional yeast</i> </li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
  2. Use the oil to fry your vegetables. 
    - _I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to my vegetables to get some umami, as I didn't have nutritional yeast!_
  3. Blend the tofu with the water, turmeric, salt and pepper. You should get a dense batter.
  4. Add the cooked vegetables to the tofu mixture, then spoon over your crust.
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is set. Let it cool for 5 minutes before cutting into it.

This crust, based on the recipe from [healthfulpursuit](http://www.healthfulpursuit.com), takes a while to make, but is gluten-free, egg-free, vegan, low carb, and has a great flavor! 


<ul>
  <li>1 + 1/4 cups ground <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a></li>
  <li>1/4 sunflower seeds, ground</li>
  <li>80-100 g onion (one small)</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>Other ingredients to taste, for example one clove of garlic (minced)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oven to 110C.
  2. Blend the onion with the oil and vinegar. 
  3. In a separate bowl mix the other ingredients, then add the onion mixture. You should get a thick paste, dry but not crumbly. If it crumbles, add some water.
  4. Grease your quiche mold very well (or even better, put a circle of parchment paper in the bottom) and put the mixture inside. Then use a spoon or your hands to form the crust. Water your hands to smooth it out.
  5. Bake for 90 minutes until it is dry and crunchy. Then, take it out and add the filling of choice,

A great, easy, tasty, keto recipe. My family adores it, it literally takes 10-15 minutes to make, and is super filling. You have to try it!

Add more oil if you want it to be more filling, or accompany with a fatty vegetable side dish.

  <li> 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>

  <li> 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce</li>

  <li> 2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li> Stevia or sweetener to taste (equals 1-2 tsp sugar)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
  <li> Optional: coriander for garnishing</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the coconut oil over high heat. Then fry the ginger for 2 minutes.
  2. Add the leeks, salt and pepper. Cook stirring frequently for about 5 minutes, until soft.

It had been so long since I published any indian food! This is one of my favorite veg curries. It is sweet with a slightly acid touch thanks to the mango powder (that can be substituted for lemon), and is awesome with some dal and rice or roti.


<ul>
  <li>500 g pumpkin or butternut squash</li>
  <li>Dried red chili (1-2)</li>
  <li>100 g onion</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida (can be subbed for 1/2 tsp garlic paste, that would be used with the ginger)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, to serve</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil (mustard or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or 1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Stevia or sweetener to taste (equivalent to 1 tsp sugar)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil. Fry the fenugreek seeds, chili and asafoetida for 2 minutes (don't burn them!!!).
  2. Add the ginger. Cook for 1 minute, then add the onion and salt. Cook on slow heat for about 10 minutes, until it is brown and soft. 
  3. Add the pumpkin and spices (except amchoor) and some more salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Then, pour 1/4 cup water and cover.
  4. Cook on low heat. Once the pumpkin is soft, add the rest of the ingredients, mix and serve.

I am so happy about this lasagna! It is vegetarian (and can be vegan if you use a vegan milk and omit the mozzarella) and low-carb, and it is as good as the traditional one!

For the sauce, you can combine milk and heavy cream as you want, and/or use vegetarian milks to lower the carb count. In my case, i used soy milk mixed with single cream.


<ul>
    <li>2 medium zucchini (400 g)</li>
    <li>2/3 chopped onion (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>50 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a> ground</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a></li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li> 
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini in thin strips of about 2 mm thick. Then cook with a little bit of olive oil on a non-stick pan, in the microwave or steam them, until they are slightly softer but not completely mushy!  
  2. Hydrate the soy in salty water or in stock.
  3. Fry the onion on medium heat about 10 minutes until it is soft. After, add the rest of ingredients and 1/2 cup of water and let everything boil until you have a nice thick sauce.
  4. For the white sauce: warm up the water and cream with the nutmeg and some salt. Then add the psyllium and mix very well (you might need a hand mixer). Adjust the texture bu adding more psyllium or more milk. 
  5. Make the lasagna alternating layers of zucchini and soy mixture, and use the bechamel to cover everything. Then add the mozzarella on top.  
  6. Bake at 180-200C for 30 minutes, putting it under the broiler in the last 5 min.

This is not really a new recipe; I just adapted my [previous cabbage roll recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRollso) to decrease the carbs, filling them with soy granules and seeds. They are as good as the original recipe, and this time I made a video on how to make the wraps. I hope you like them. 



<ul>
    <li>One whole cabbage head (we will use the 8 outer leaves, about 260 g)</li>
    <li>70 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds (65g), chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1/2 onion (80g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Spices: 1 tsp spicy paprika,</li> 
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li> 
    <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li> 
    <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li> 
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups of tomato purée (passata)</li> 
    <li>6 cloves</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>A pinch of salt</li> 
    <li>Some sugar or stevia (optional)</li> 
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. First, boil the whole cabbage. I made it in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes. Then, cool with water to stop any further cooking. 
  2. Hydrate the soy granules. Meanwhile, gently fry the onion with 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and bay leaf.
    * If you want the onion to be extra soft and sweet, you can make it like I did  [in my other recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRolls)
  3. Once the onion is soft, add the spices and cook for a minute. Then, add the soy, seeds and tomato paste. Cook for 5 more minutes and then let it cool. You can add fresh parsley or coriander if you like it.
  4. Take the 8 outer cabbage leaves. Put them flat over a surface and, with a knife, trim the stem without cutting all the way through.
  5. Divide the soy mixture into eight, and put a portion onto each cabbage leaf. Then, wrap like I show in the video. 
  6. Put the rolls in a big pot in one or two layers, leaving little space between them. Mix the ingredients for the sauce (all the other ingredients) and pour over the rolls. 
  7. Let them boil for about 30 minutes.
  8. Serve with flax bread, rice, salad...

This is an easy week-night dinner that my mom would make quite often when I was a kid. It was one of the few vegetable dishes that I actually enjoyed! 

I tweaked it a little bit to make it lower carb and higher in fat, and the result is delicious :D 


<ul>
    <li>One big eggplant (550-600g)</li>
    <li>50 g of tuna (canned in brine)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (40 g) parmesan</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch of chili to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, cut the eggplant lenthgwise and cook it until it is tender: you can cook it in the microwave, in the oven or in a pan.
  2. Once cooked through, use a spoon to scoop out the flesh of the eggplant, leaving the skin and part of the flesh to stuff later.
  3. In a bowl, chop the eggplant flesh finely, and then add all the other ingredients (leave some of the parmesan to use as topping) and mix.
  4. Use the mixture to fill in the eggplant skins. Top with more cheese.
  5. Warm up for the filling to set, either in the microwave or in the oven.

I love this curry and its aromatic, thick sauce. It's a real crowd-pleaser. The traditional way of making it takes forever, but I used [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1qXKTbqOM) as reference, since it is easier and takes "only" one hour to make. 

For the sauce you can use cashews, which make it creamier, but I used almonds to lower the carbs in the recipe.

Eat it with rice, naan or, in my case, salad and cauli-rice :D 


<ul>
  <li>325 g white onion</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2 cm ginger or 1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp oil (I used mustard oil)</li>
  <li>420 g chicken breast (you could use drumsticks instead; it will be even better!)</li>
  <li>30 whole, peeled almonds (40-45g), soaked in water for 24h</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut milk</li>
  <li>3/4 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>5 cm cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>10 cloves</li>
  <li>10 green cardamom</li>
  <li>3 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1-1.5 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: some sugar or stevia, if you want the sauce to be sweet.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, blend the ingredients for the onion purée until smooth: onions, garlic, ginger. Separately, form the almond paste, blending the almonds, 3 tbsp coconut milk and 3 tbsp water.
  2. In a pan, heat up the oil and fry the whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick) 2 minutes, without burning them. 
  3. Add the onion purée and a bit of salt and cook, stirring often, for about 15 minutes on medium-high. Be careful not to let it stick to the bottom of the pan. 
  4. Meanwhile, cube the chicken (if using drumsticks, leave them whole) and blend the ingredients for the almond paste.
  5. Once the onion has formed a pretty dry paste, take off the stove and add the ground spices. Cook for about a minute. Then, add in the chicken with some salt and brown for 5 minutes.
  6. Pour the coconut milk and 3/4 cup of water and mix well to form a thick sauce. Lower the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Add more water if it starts to get dry.  
  7. Finally, add the almond paste and the garam masala and mix. Add more water if you want a thinner sauce. Let everything boil for a couple of minutes and serve.

This is an italian dish perfect for carnivores, but it also works wonderfully using seitan instead of chicken (_but if you are using seitan, the final carb count will be higher_. The final result is a slightly thick sauce, acidic from the lemon and capers, and with smooth buttery texture... Perfect with salad, rice or cauli-rice! 

If you follow a ketogenic diet, do not hesitate on adding more butter - the more, the better :D 

<ul>
  <li>750 g chicken breast fillets, or 6 seitan steaks</li>
  <li>1/3 medium onion (60g), sliced finely</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>2 tbsp capers</li>
  <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
  <li>One chicken stock cube (optional)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (125 mL) white wine</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60 mL) lemon juice</li>
  <li>The zest of half a lemon</li>
  <li>About 1/4 cup of chopped parsley</li>
  <li>1 tbsp flax meal</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, brown the chicken (with some salt) using a bit of the butter over medium-high. Leave the browned pieces on the side for later. 
  2. Add the rest of butter and oil in the pan and fry the onion and garlic over medium-low for 10-15 minutes, until it's brown and soft. 
  3. Add the meat back in and pour the wine. Let it simmer about 5 minutes for the alcohol to evaporate. Mix well.
  4. After, add the capers, some black pepper and half the parsley. Mix well. 
  5. Finally, add the flax (to thicken the sauce) and the lemon juice. Turn off the stove and garnish with the rest of the parsley and some lemon slices.

This is super tasty for taco night, but will work for any recipe in which you want to substitute minced meat - just adapt the spices to the recipe you are using! 

If you are using it for mexican food - I would recommend adding some minced vegan chorizo for a more intense flavor. A recipe will be coming up soon!


<ul>
  <li> 50 g small soy granules</li>
  <li> 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
  <li> 1 cup vegetable stock</li>
  <li> 1/2 small red onion (30 g)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> Optional: fresh coriander, to garnish</li>
</ul>



* **Process**
  1. Chop the pumpkin seeds roughly. Put the soy and the seeds in a bowl with the soy sauce and the stock for at least 10-15 minutes to hidrate.
  2. Heat up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Fry on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes until it looks soft.
  3. Add the spices and the tomato purée. Mix and cook for about 1 minute.
  4. Add the soy-seed mixture with its liquid and cook for a few minutes until it warms up. You can add more liquid if you want, or dry it out more to your liking.
  5. Turn off the stove, add the lemon juice and coriander and eat!

This is a very easy dish with few ingredients, full of fiber, very healthy, and keto-friendly.

I don't eat meat so I'm using seitan that I minced, but for omnivores, you could use ground meat (preferably a very fatty one, which would make this higher in fat).

<ul>
    <li>1/2 medium cabbage, thinly sliced (400g)</li>
    <li>1/6 red onion (30 g), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>80 g seitan minced, OR minced meat</li>
    <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>1/2 or 1 whole garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce + 1/4 tsp kelp powder (optional) OR 1 tbsp soy sauce + 2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp tahini paste or peanut butter</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>Sweetener of choice - I used stevia</li>
    <li>To serve: lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, fry the ginger and garlic on the oil for 30 seconds.
  2. Add the cabbage and onion. Cook covered on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the soy sauce, kelp, tahini, black pepper and chili powder.
  3. When it starts to soften, add the seitan (or meat)and mix. Cook for another 2 minutes. 
  4. Then,add the sauce, mix and cook for a couple of minutes. 
  5. When the cabbage is soft, add the eggs as shown in the video: add them raw and mix fast, so they cook covering the cabbage to make it moist.

Super easy and incredibly delicious recipe. Can be vegan and gluten-free, and is full of fiber, flavor, healthy fats – and great for keto-ers! Just add some more fat to fit your macros, and use whatever vegetables you prefer. And if you wish to avoid tofu, you can use paneer (although this will increase the fat content of the recipe).

I like to at it with a big green salad and some keto bread. Makes for an awesome meal to pack for work!


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>600 g tofu OR 450 g paneer</li>
    <li>1/3 of a purple onion, thinly sliced (35 g)</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>100 g spinach, cooked (I use frozen spinach that I then cook in the microwave!)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of coconut milk (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp powdered cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp red chili powder (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 basil leaves optional</li>
    <li>Sugar to taste (I used stevia)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (or 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp fish sauce)</li>
    <li>Half a bunch of broccoli (250 g) (previously steamed, or use it raw and let it cook longer)</li>
    <li>Optional: 60 g of carrot (omit if keto)</li>
    <li>Optional: some fresh coriander</li>
    <li>To garnish: 40 g roasted or fried almonds or peanuts, chopped</li>
    <li>To garnish: lemon or lime</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Start by frying the onion, ginger and carrots over medium heat
  2. In a blender, blend the ingredients for the sauce: spinach, coconut milk, cumin, coriander, chili, black pepper, basil, stevia, soy sauce. Set aside for later. 
  3. Once the onions are very soft, add the tofu and cook over medium-high until it gets golden.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until they are tender (I used steamed broccoli so I only cooked it for 2 minutes so it would warm up). 
  5. Add the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. 
  6. Turn of the heat, sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve with some lemon or lime.

Since going keto two weeks ago I have been craving good indian food. Unfortunately, dal chawal (lentil curry with rice) is not really keto-friendly, so an egg curry with some salad and/or cauli-rice seemed like a good enough substitute!

This is more of a pattern to make a very easy egg curry. I usually just add more or less spices depending on how I am feeling that day, so feel free to change the amounts and/or add other spices or ingredients - maybe amchoor, some chunks of red bell pepper... Experiment!

<ul> 
    <li>18 boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    <li>400 g tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>300 g onions, chopped</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>An inch of ginger, chopped (or 1 tsp ginger paste)</li>
    <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 tbsp oil (I am using mustard oil)</li>
    <li>Optional: sugar or sweetener of choice</li> 
    <li>1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream (6-g) (you can sub for greek yogurt or coconut milk)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat the oil in a saucepan, then add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat until they are quite soft. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes for the raw smell to go away. 
  3. Add the spices and cook for 1 minute. If it's too dry and you are scared they will burn, add some water. 
  4. Add the tomatoes, salt and tomato paste. Cover and cook on low for about 10-15 minutes, until the tomatoes are very soft. 
  5. _Optional step: you can fry the peeled eggs for a couple of minutes with some oil; this gets them slightly crunchy outside._
  6. Once the tomatoes are soft, blend the sauce and add the yogurt and sugar. Add some water if the sauce is too thick.
  7. Put it back into the stove, add the eggs (whole or cut in half), let them boil together for a couple of minutes and serve with some fresh coriander.

This is one of my hostess' specialty, vegetable pulao, for 4-5 people. An easy one-dish meal that can be slightly changed and always comes out equally delicious. You can use chatever vegetables you ike, such as green peas, broccoli cauliflower, potatoes, red capsisum...


<ul>
  <li>Vegetables, chopped: 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1/2 green capsicum pepper, handful of green beans, green chili to taste.</li>
  <li>_Optional, to add more protein: textured soy protein, soaked_</li>
  <li>Whole masala: 4 bay leaves, 4 green cardamoms crushed, 2 black cardamom, 4-5 cm stick of cinnamon, 10 cloves, 12 black peppercorns + 10 small whole garlic cloves</li>
  <li>Rice: about a cup (roughly the same volume as the vegetables), rinsed</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>Red chili to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek leaves (optional)</li>
  <li>Sugar to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1-2 tsp salt, in total</li>
  <li>Optional: yoghurt or curd (especially good for leftovers!)</li>
  <li> To garnish: coriander (about 1/2 cup), lemon juice, mint (usually saved for meat pulaos)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan with 3-4 tbsp oil (or less, if you are fat-conscious), add the whole masala and brown them on low heat.
  2. Add the onions and cook them for 15-20 minutes, until they are super brown and caramelised and delicious.
  3. Add the carrots and cook them for a couple of minutes to avoid them being raw in the end. Then, add all the other veggies. Cook and cover until slightly soft, on low heat.
  4. Add the soy meat, salt and spices and mix thoroughly. After a couple of minutes, add the rice, mix, add the turmeric, and mix again.
  5. Now, you can either add some water and fresh coriander and cook it without a lid, or pressure cook it for 2 whistles on high flame.
  6. Once the rice is cooked through, fluff up with a fork, garnish with some more coriander, and enjoy.

                <div class="post-content">
                    <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/609/31552398312_4d6638dcdd_o_d.jpg" />


While in India I visited Bangalore. In indian restaurants in Europe the food that is mostly served is North Indian. However, south indian cuisine has so much variety and uses such different flavours when compared to North Indian! 

In this case, I was taught how to make Bisi Bele Bath, a wonderful south indian dish for the rainy season. It is usually a one-pot meal, the perfect comfort food to have in a cozy evening, enough to serve 6 people. 

The friend that taught this to me tweaks the recipe a little bit, mixing different dals and using two pots instead of one. However, if you want to go for the most traditional version, use only toor dal and rice (it can be cooked in the same pot and at the same time as the rice), and skip the tadka; this will make for an easier one-pot meal.


<ul>
  <li>2 cup of mixed dal</li>
  <li>3 fistfuls of rice and 2 of broken wheat (you can use all rice for the traditional version, about 1.5 cups)</li>
  <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
  <li>_Optional: 2 tomatoes, chopped_</li>
  <li>4-5 small shallots, peeled and whole, or a few pieces of green capsicum</li>
  <li>_Optional: a few green beans, chopped_</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li>1/2-1 tbsp tamarind paste (if you dont have any, you can use lemon juice instead)</li>
  <li>5-6 tbsp of bisibelebath masala mixture OR: 1.5 tbsp coriander powder, 1 tbsp black gram dal powder, 2-3 tsp chili powder, 1-1.5 tsp cumin powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp fenugreek powder, 3-4 cloves and a few curry leaves</li>
  <li>For the tadka (optional): pinch of asafoetida, dried red chilies to taste, a bunch of curry leaves, 1 tsp black mustard seeds, 1-2 tbsp roasted bengal gram (optional) or cashews, vegetable oil</li>
  <li>_Optional: jaggery or sugar to taste, cashew nuts (if not used in tadka)_</li>
  <li>_Optional: fresh coriander to garnish_</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash and rinse the dal a couple of times. Tren, soak for at least 4 hours. 
  2. In a fast cooker,pour the dal with its soaking water, then add some salt, asafoetida, turmeric, shallots and carrots. Close the lid and let it whistle about 3 times or until it smells like the dal is cooked. 
  3. Meanwhile, rinse the rice and broken wheat properly. Then, put it in a pot with salted water and boil until cooked.
  4. Now, mix the cooked dal and rice in the pot where you cooked the rice in and add the tomatoes. 
  5. Once the tomatoes are soft, add the bisibelebath masala. Mix well and cook together for a couple of minutes. Add water if it is too thick. 
  6. Add the tamarind into the mixture. Then, taste for salt and sweetness. 
  7. Finally (optionally), make the tadka. Heat up 2-3 tbsp of oil in a small pan and fry the whole spices until brown in this order: asafoetida, mustard seeds, chillies, bengal gram and curry leaves. Once it is done, add it into the pot and put a lid on it for the aromas to infuse. 
  8. Mix everything and serve.

There are many vegetarian people in India, so traditional spanish cuisine (very often pork-based) is not very appropriate here, and on top of that, anything european is considered bland (because no chili, no taste, apparently!). So finding something to cook that they would like (that wasnt indian food!) seemed difficult.

So... chili to the rescue! I make my chili meatless and with loooooads of veggies (way more than the usual chili con carne have), and I like to add some cacao for a deeper, earthier flavor. I had to omit some spices, but I will transcribe the recipe I usually make so you can enjoy it to the fullest! 

For those who watch the videos: im so sorry about the terrible picture quality. But cooking in a new kitchen with limited resources and at 40 degrees temperature, being a good photographer was the least of my worries :)


<ul>
  <li>400 g cooked kidney beans (rajma), about 3 cups</li>
  <li>2 cloves of garlic, very finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
  <li>3 red bell peppers, finely chopped (you can sub one for a different color pepper)</li>
  <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
  <li>300-400 g tomato puree</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>Spices (adjust to your taste): 1/2-1 tsp cumin, _1/2 tsp oregano optional_, 1/4 tsp black pepper, _1/4 tsp cinnamon powder optional_, 1 tbsp cacao powder, 1-2 tbsp sugar, _10 g of dark cooking chocolate optional_, 1 tsp of chipotle paste _(you can substitute it for 1 tsp of red chili powder and, if you want, cook the peppers on an open flame for a couple of minutes to get that smoky flavor one gets from the chipotle.)_</li>
  <li>_Optional: 1/2 cup of corn grains, raw_</li> 
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a large pot or pan with 2-3 tbsp olive oil, add the onions and garlic with 1/4 tsp of salt. Cook on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes until nice and soft. 
  2. Add the peppers and corn with 1/4 tsp of salt and cook, covered, for about 10 minutes until the peppers start to soften. 
  3. Add the spices (except for the chocolate) and cook 1-2 minutes. Then, add the tomato paste, puree and the tomatoes chopped, along with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 cup of water and cook on a low heat, uncovered. 
  4. After 15-20 minutes it should start to be nice and thick. It should cook for at least 20-30 minutes, so add a bit of water if it is becoming too dry. 
  5. When there are only a couple of minutes left for it to finish, add the chocolate and mix it well so it melts. Then, taste and add salt, chili or even chocolate if you need it. 
  6. Serve nice and warm. It can stay in the fridge for 3-4 days, and it even gets better flavor! It is also freezer-friendly, so I usually make a huge batch and freeze some for another week.

                <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/sausage">Vegan Sausage</a></h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/31326152400_e4b9f7eb3a_o_d.jpg" />

My boyfriend (who so lovingly codes everything for my website, and is the one responsible for the gorgeous look it has!) loves sausages for breakfast. It is one of the few things that I don't like him eating, since it is very fatty, processed, unhealthy meat. The only other things he would like for breakfast usually involve a long time of cooking, so I have been trying to come up with a savory breakfast for him that does not include chicken and can be cooked fast in the morning.

So, these sausages came to be: meaty, spicy sausages, that take a little bit of prepping time but that can last in the fridge (or freezer) for a while, making for an easy breakfast, but also awesome in pizzas or sandwiches. You will be gladly surprised when you try it! In fact, I like these better than traditional sausages :)

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup cooked chickpeas or white beans, mashed with a fork</li>
  <li>Spices: 1 tsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp crushed fennel seeds (the recipe I used in the beginning suggested 1 tsp of ground fennel seed instead, but I rather prefer the crushed seed version), 1 tsp spicy paprika, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1 cup of vegetable broth</li>
  <li>1+1/4 cups of vital wheat gluten</li>
  <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Firstly, prepare your water in the steamer.
  2. Mix in a bowl the nutritional yeast and the wheat gluten. In a different bowl, mix all the other ingredients. 
  3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix thoroughly. You will end up with an elastic ball that forms "threads" (those are your proteins!). 
  4. Make the shape you want: either form small sausages or one big loaf. Cover each sausage/loaf with cheese cloth.
   - _If you don't have any cheese cloth, I recommend using sterile gauze pads (If you have a doctor in the family, you will probably have some around the house!)_
  5. Place on your steamer and steam about 35 minutes if making small sausages, or about 50 min if making one big loaf. The cooking time depends a lot on the size of your sausages, so it can vary a lot. If in doubt, just cut it in half and check that the center has changed its texture, losing that "thready" property it had when raw.
  6. Eat immediately or save for later.

                <h2 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/chewmeinEng">Spiralized chowmein</a></h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/608/31698792525_4c207670e9_o_d.jpg" />

Chowmein is an indo-chinese dish, very typical from Nepal: streetfood served often in doubtious places, but delicious!  

Normally this would use whole-wheat noodles, but I decided to substitute them for spiralized vegetables. I am using turnips, but you could use other white vegetables. It also usually has carrot but I am avoiding it to keep it low-carb. 

The most popular ones are Veg Chowmein (vegetarian) and Chicken Chowmein (chicken), although other types of meat can be used, or shrimp or egg. I sometimes make it using tofu (to have some protein but keep it vegan), but whoever wants to can add the meat or shrimp along with the vegetables so they fry together. And of course, quantities are just to orientate you, and can be adapted!

This is a strong and tasty dish, spicy and slightly sweet, perfect for 3-4 people. I hope you like it.

<ul>
  <li>3 spiralized turnips, 360g (or you can substitute for whole-wheat noodles)</li>
  <li>1/4 cabbage (300g), thinly sliced (you can use the spiralizer for this!)</li>
  <li>1/2 red bell pepper (60g), cut in trips</li>
  <li>1 medium red onion (100g)</li>
  <li>Other optional vegetables, such as a handful of boiled green beans</li>
  <li>250 g firm tofu (optional)</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves very finely chopped or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>Strips of fresh ginger (that should be added with the other vegetables) or 2 tsp ginger paste (that would be added with the garlic)</li>
  <li>3 eggs (optional)</li>
  <li>Optional: spring onions, for garnishing</li>
  <li>4 tsp soy sauce (half could be substituted for oyster sauce, for non-vegetarian people)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp red chili paste or red chili powder (this should be adapted to taste; 1 tsp is very spicy)</li>
  <li>Salt. </li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tsp rice vinager, lime juice, or something similar</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut oil</li>
  <li>To serve: ketchup and chili sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a big enough pan, over medium-high heat, put a tablespoon of oil and then fry the cubed tofu until golden, for about 5 minutes. Later, take it out and put aside for later. 
  2. Pour the rest of the oil in the pan and add the onion. Let them cook for 5 minutes. When they start to turn translucent, add the rest of the vegetables and cook until tender.
  3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes so it loses the raw flavor.
  4. Add the vegetable "noodles", mix well and then pour the sauce over everything.
  5. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the "noodles" are tender. Check for salt. 
  6. Serve with some kétchup and chili sauce on top.

Chicken Tikka Masala (that can also be made with paneer or tofu to keep it vegetarian) is one of the most typical dishes in indian restaurants. It has a thick onion and tomato sauce, spicy with a sweet touch, that is always a hit. 

On top of that, it is easier to make than it seems. It doesn't require many ingredients, and it always comes out great. Try it!



<ul>
  <li>700 g chicken or paneer tikka</li> 
  <li>4 peeled tomatoes (450 g or 3 cups)</li>
  <li>1 chopped medium onion (110g)</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped, or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>2'5 cm minced ginger or 1.5 tsp ginger paste <i>(use 2/3 of the amount if making paneer or tofu tikka masala)</i></li>
  <li>Stevia to taste (equivalent to 2 tbsp brown sugar)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili or to taste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil or ghee</li>
  <li>Optional: 4 tbsp heavy cream (or yoghurt). <i>(You can substitute it for coconut milk if you want a vegan Tikka Masala.)</i></li> 
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil and fry the onions for 5 min.
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 min.
  3. Add the spices and mix around, cooking it for 30 seg.
  4. Add the rest of the ingredients, cover and cook on low heat for 20 min.
  5. Take off the heat and process the sauce until smooth. Add the cream or yoghurt, and then the chicken or paneer tikka.
  6. Let everything boil together for a few minutes and serve with pilao rice.

A good way of sneaking some vegetables inside of the pizza... It's very hard to tell the crust is made of cauliflower!

And it's a great way of having a low-carb, high-fiber dinner. 

Don't be skeptical and give it a try. It is delicious!

<ul>
  <li>1 big cauliflower or 5 cups (600g) of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a></li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan (70g)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Put the cauliflower rice in two batches in the microwave for 5 minutes. Afterwards, put all the cooked cauliflower into a clean teatowel, fold it and squeeze as much water as you can. If your arms are starting to hurt, you are doing it right. You should spend 5 or 10 minutes doing this, so the final result has good consistency.
  2. Once squeezed properly, mix all the ingredients and preheat your oven to 180C
  3. Poner la masa sobre un papel de horno en una bandeja de horno y darle forma con las manos. 
   - _The thickness depends on your taste, but it should be even. For pizza I make it 0.3 cm thick, but you can also make tortillas making it very thin, and later on use them for wraps._
  4. Bake until golden. It is a good idea to put it on the lower part of the oven for the last couple of minutes so that the base doesn't end up soggy.
  5. Take out of the oven, put the toppings you like, bake it for a couple more minutes so the cheese melts, and... _voilà!_

This is, hands down, my favorite spiralized recipe. 

It literally takes 5 minutes to put together, it's healthy, flavourful, balanced... I could eat it every day!

<ul>
  <li>1 medium sized zucchini, spiralized (200g)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>3 tbsp cream cheese (45g)</li>
  <li>100g canned tuna, drained</li>
  <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1tbsp Balsamic vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, put a teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Once it's hot, add the zoodles and cook with the garlic powder, salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, just enough time for them to start getting soft. 
   - _If overcooked, the zoodles will release water._
  2. Add the cheese and then mix everything, so the cheese melts and forms a sauce. 
  3. Serve with tuna, olive oil and vinager.

A very easy to make, healthy and tasty recipe. The different flavours combine perfectly, and I often omit the ham for a vegan version. Steaming the eggplant makes the flavour stand out a lot, which I find lovely, but if you are not an eggplant fan, this is not for you!

<ul>
  <li>2 eggplants</li>
  <li>100 g cubed tofu</li>
  <li>50-100 g cubed or sliced and chopped ham (optional; can be omitted for a vegan version)</li>
  <li>For the sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp white whine (or 1 tbsp vinager and a bit of honey, to taste), optional: 1-2 cloves of garlic finely chopped, optional: 1/2 tsp ginger paste, ground black pepper, salt (depending on how salty the soy sauce is), 1 tbsp corn starch</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, or fresh parsley for those who don't like coriander</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Prepare a pan in which you will steam the eggplant.
  2. Cut the eggplants lenghtwise and make some cuts into the flesh without going all the way through.
  3. Put the eggplants on the recipient where you will steam them later.. 
  4. Put the ham and tofu on top, and then pour the sauce over everything for it to impregnate the eggplant. Garnish with a little bit of coriander or parsley.
   - _Don't spill the sauce; if there is too much, keep it and add it a couple of minutes before it is done cooking._
  5. Steam for about 25 minutes until the eggplants are tender. Add some more coriander or parsley, then serve.

Another great way to use the cauliflower "rice": make chinese fried rice! It was a huge hit with my guests :)
 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup processed cauliflower or 3 cups (360g) of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a></li>
  <li>180g g shrimp (I buy frozen raw shrimp and thaw)</li>
  <li>40 g boiled green peas (mine were canned)</li>
  <li>1/2 carrot, cubed (30g)</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3 tbsp coconut oil (or 2 of coconut oil and 1 of sesame oil)</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste (1-2 cloves)</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
  <li>3 tbsp (20g) Spring onion to garnish</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil, add the garlic and ginger. After cooking for a minute, add the carrots with a bit of salt and pepper. 
  2. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the carrot is slightly soft. Turn up the heat and add the shrimp. 
  3. Cook the shrimp for a couple of minutes and then add the green peas. Cook for one minute.
  4. Add the processed cauliflower, soy sauce, stir very well and cook for a couple of minutes until the cauliflower is soft. 
  5. Make a small space in the pan and crack the eggs on it; cook them mixing constantly, then incorporating them onto the rice. Check salt and pepper. 
  6. Garnish with spring onion.

                <div class="post-content">
                    <img src= "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/273/31698838425_d6a909cc53_o_d.jpg" />

One of my favourite vegetarian foods is palak paneer, a spinach and cheese curry. There is only one minor problem with it, and it is precisely one of its key ingredients: Paneer.

Don't get me wrong. I love it. But I cannot seem to be able to find it in stores, trying to replace it with other cheeses just leads to weird-looking attempts at the recipe, and making the paneer myself... well. has anyone tried to make paneer from scratch on a busy week?
Um... not very practical. 

So, the ultimate way to make palak paneer is to not make palak paneer at all, but to make palak TOFU. Yup, you read that right. Tofu actually has quite a neutral flavour that works very well with the spices of the dish, it holds its shape properly, gives nice texture and colour, and from a nutritional point of view, I quite prefer it to the paneer. 

I know this may sound strange, but seriously: my lovely indian boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, and he was so impressed that I had actually taken the time to make the paneer from scratch... it was only after several times of making it that I told him it was tofu! 


<ul>
  <li>300 g paneer or tofu (if using tofu: freeze and defreeze so it firms up)</li>
  <li>450 g frozen chopped spinach</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil (3 if using tofu)</li>
  <li>1/2 big onion,  finely chopped (75 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or 2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 green chili, desseded and sliced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 bay leafs or 1 big indian bay leaf</li> 
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp red chili powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp heavy whipping cream (4 tbsp if using tofu)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dry fenugreek leaves (you can leave it out and maybe add 1&2 tsp cinnamon and garnish with coriander, but the flavor will be very different)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cook the spinach according to the package instructions (I cook mine in the microwave). 
  2. In a pan, put some oil (1/2-1 tbsp) with the whole spices and the chili. Once they start warming up, add the garlic, ginger and onion, with a pinch of salt. 
  3. Brown in the pan for about 10 minutes until the onion is tender. Then, add the powdered spices and cook for one minute. 
  4. Add the spinach with some water and salt. Let cook for 5 minutes. 
  5. Add the tofu and let cook together for a couple of minutes. 
  6. Let it cook until the water has evaporated to the consistency of the gravy you like. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the yoghurt and the fenugreek leaves and serve.

* **Process**

  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours. **_Very important to marinate properly in this case since we are using less spices; otherwise the chicken might be bland._**
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

  6. Cook until dry and crunchy, at least 30 minutes.

This simplified version of Goi Ga, a vietnamese salad, is a unique combination of flavours. Don´t miss it! 

You can change the ingredients slightly to fit your macros (for example, using more chicken). If you are doing keto, you might want to add some more oil to the recipe.

  <li>Optional: 1/2 cup Bean sprouts</li>
  <li>1/2 red onion (50g)</li>
  <li>Fresh mint (aprox. 1/2 cup) (essential!)</li>
  <li>Cubed cooked boneless chicken thighs (2 chicken thighs, 300 g when raw)</li>
  <li><i>Optional: 1/4 cup fresh coriander</i></li>
  <li>Optional: One carrot (if using, carb count will increase)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup peanuts (100g) or almonds, fried or toasted, chopped</li>
  <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple vinager if not available)</li>
  <li>Stevia to taste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive or coconut oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp lime or lemon juice</li>
  <li>1-2 clove of garlic very finely chopped (or coarsely chopped, letting it infuse and then fishing it out)</li>
  <li>Optional: 3-4 chopped spring onion (45 g)</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper, pinch of powdered chilli</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Chop everything. It´s very important to slice the cabbage very finely. 
  2. Make the dressing with the olive, vinegar, lemon juice, fish sauce, garlic, salt, pepper and chili. Then add enough stevia to have a mostly sweet dressing but that still has some acidic hints to it. 
  3. Put everything in a salad bowl, dress it, mix and serve.

This is a very typical indian entrée, that can be made with chicken, paneer, or even vegetables like mushrooms. I like to have it as a main course with a big green salad with lots of olive oil, as well as some fresh tomato, red onions and coriander. 

If you cannot find tandoori masala, you can use [this recipe instead](http://maria.recipes/chickenTandoori2)

<ul>
  <li>4 chicken thighs, with bone (if boneless, should be around 800 g)</li>
  <li>1 cup yoghurt (10% fat)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp tandoori masala</li>
  <li>Ginger paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>Garlic paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt (start with less and add to taste)</li>
  <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
  
* **Process**
  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours.
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
  5. Put the chicken on the griddle and a baking sheet underneath to collect any juices.
  6. Cook until dry and crunchy, at least 30 minutes.
  7. Let rest a couple of minutes before serving.

This is a great filling for a wrap. You can use a crepe-type wrap like I did, or other things like tortillas, chapati or dosa to keep it vegan.
<ul>
  <li>1 cup flour (whole wheat or all-purpose flour)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>Three tomatos</li>
  <li>Half an onion or one shalot, fresh parsley or coriander, salt</li>
  <li>One avocado</li>
  <li>400 g of cooked red kidney beans.</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp tomato paste, to taste. If not available, can be substituted for fresh tomato (but will require longer cooking time).</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste (1/2 tsp)</li>
  <li>Spices, to taste: 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 onion.</li>
  <li>Chili, to taste. I use 3-4 fresh chilies, taking the seeds out.</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. To form the crepe mixture, mix the dry ingredients, add the egg, mix and then add the water (1-1.5 cups), a little bit at a time, until you get a thin consistency. Let it sit for 10-15 min. Then cook in a very lightly greased nonstick pan on medium-high heat.
  2. For the tomato mixture, chop the tomatoes, half an onion, parsley or coriander and salt and mix; do not add the salt until the very end to prevent the tomato from releasing water.
     - _If the raw onion flavour is too much, put the chopped onion in cold water for 10-15 min before using._
  3. To prepare the avocado: slice it, add some lemon juice, salt and pepper and mix.
  4. To prepare the filling: 
     - Fry the onion, if using; then, add all the ingredients at the same time. 
     - _I use the red kidney beans with the liquid from the jar too, but if you want to, you can substitute it for water._
     - Cook on medium heat, stirring, until the mixture is quite thick.
  6. Fill the crepes with the tomato, avocado and beans, wrap it up and eat! 

A perfect recipe for meatless days!

                    <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/758/31661918516_311af00836_o_d.jpg" />
<ul>
  <li>1 cup dal (dry lentils); I like using red lentils, which cook fast</li>
  <li>3 onions</li>
  <li>Optional: tomato, peppers or any veggies lying around the kitchen</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh green chillies to taste (I use 3)</li>
  <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste (about 2 garlic cloves)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tsp  garam masala (to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Optional, to garnish: lemon, fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. En a casserole, put water with a pinch of turmeric and the dal; once boiling, cover and simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally.
  2. Meanwhile, in a pan, add some oil and the cumin seeds. 
  3. Once the cumin is golden, add the chili and onions (and any other vegetable you might use that takes long to cook).
  4. Cook on medium heat until the onion is tender. 
  5. Add the garlic and the ginger paste and cook stirring for a minute.
  6. Add the other spices.
     * _At this point you could add soft vegetables such as tomatoes and let them cook for a couple of minutes._
  7. Cook about 30 sec-1 min, then turn off the heat. 
  8. During this time, the dal should've been cooking; the simmering time depends on the type of lentil and your taste (30-60min)
     * _I don't mind if my dal stil has some texture to it, but if you leave it long enough, it will form a puree like in the video_
     * _If the dal is too liquid, turn up the heat and cook uncovered a couple of minutes; if it's too dense, add a splash of water._
  9. Mix in the vegetables with the dal and cook together for 5-10 minutes.

Serve with a splash of lemon juice and some fresh coriander.

<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
  <li>2-3 green chillies / dried red chillies</li>
  <li>1/2 a lemon, squeezed (1 tbsp lemon juice)</li>
  <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 inch piece cinnamon</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 black cardamom</li>
  <li>2 tsp roasted cumin powder (dry roast in a pan for about 5 minutes, then powder)</li>
  <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cup black tea (let the tea bag in the hot water for 3 minutes)</li>
  <li>2 roma tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/4 cup onion, chopped (plus extra for garnishing)</li>
  <li>2 cans canned chickpeas/ garbanzo beans, drained and washed - about 500-600 grams</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
</ul>
* **Process**

  1. In a big enough saucepan, heat the oil. Add in the cinnamon, bay leaves, black cardamom and cumin seeds (and dried red chillies if using any). 
  2. Cook for 30 seconds until the aroma develops.
  3. Add the ginger, garlic and green chillies. Cook stirring for 30 seconds.
  4. Add the onions and cook on medium heat, covered, until soft.
  5. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5-10 minutes.
  6. Pour the tea and the chickpeas into the pan. Add salt to taste and the rest of spices. 
  7. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
  8. Add the lemon juice, test to adjust seasoning. 
  9. Mix the coriander leaves, garnish with raw onion and serve with lemon slices.

_The best to use is red onion for the garnishing; if non available, I recommend leaving them in cold water for 10 minutes so their taste gets milder._

<ul>
  <li>500 g cooked red kidney beans</li>
  <li>2 tbsp besan (chickpea flour) - can be subbed for oat flour or breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>

  3. Form the “burguers” using your wet hands. 
     - _Optional: coat with breadcrubs, which makes the forming easier._ 
  4. Cook in an oiled pan over medium-high heat, not moving it in the first few minutes.

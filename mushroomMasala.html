This is a dish that my bae and I love. He is usually not a big fan of vegetables, but when I make this, it disappears in no time! And I love it too not just because of the flavour, but because it takes very little time to make (the most annoying part is chopping the vegetables!).</p>

<p>The final result is very good, and combines wonderfully with some plain basmati rice. For those who want to, sometimes I like to add some pan-fried paneer or tofu to have some more protein in my meal.</p>

<p>An easy and  yummy curry, itŽs worth trying!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>, <em>serves 3 people</em>
    <ul>
      <li>250 g sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
      <li>1 medium-sized tomato</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li><em>If you have no fresh tomato available, you can use more tomato paste and add some water instead.</em></li>
      <li>Spices: 1/2 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp powdered chili (or to taste)</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li><em>Optional: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</em></li>
      <li>Lemon juice, to taste</li>
      <li><em>Optional: fresh coriander to garnish</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, add the onion with a bit of salt and brown them for about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and ginger and let them cook for 1-2 minutes, so they loose their “raw” flavour.</li>
      <li>Turn down the heat and add the powdered spices and let them roast for about a minute to become more fragrant (if the pan is too dry and the spices might burn, add a bit of water).</li>
      <li>Add the mushrooms with a bit of salt, mix, turn the heat to medium and cover.</li>
      <li>Cook stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are almost cooked.</li>
      <li>Add the tomato and the tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes until the tomato is broken down.</li>
      <li>Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves crushing them between your fingers, add some lemon juice and serve. If you like, you can garnish with some coriander, too!</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

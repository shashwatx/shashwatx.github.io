This is, hands down, my favorite spiralized recipe.</p>

<p>It literally takes 5 minutes to put together, it’s healthy, flavourful, balanced… I could eat it every day!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>, <em>serves one</em>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium sized zucchini, spiralized</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>2-3 cheese in portions (I use low-fat Laughing Cow cheese)</li>
      <li>One small can of tuna, drained</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Balsamic vinager, salt, pepper</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pan, put a teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the zoodles and cook with the garlic powder, salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, just enough time for them to start getting soft.
        <ul>
          <li><em>If overcooked, the zoodles will release water.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add the cheese and then mix everything, so the cheese melts and forms a sauce.</li>
      <li>Serve with tuna, olive oil and vinager.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

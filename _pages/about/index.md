Maria Silva was born in Madrid (Spain), where she did her studies.  
Shashwat Mishra was born in Deoria and studied in Kanpur (India).  
But destiny led them both to France in 2013.  
She loved to cook, he loved to eat, and her curries conquered his tummy and his heart.  

Now they want to share their happiness with the world.

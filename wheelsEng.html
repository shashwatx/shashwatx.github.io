<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Sliced ham (you can use slices of chicken ham as well)</li>
      <li><em>Its best that the slices are not too thin.</em></li>
      <li>Whatever cheese you like best: I like mixing cream cheese with roquefort.</li>
      <li>Other ingredients to taste: raisins, olives, walnuts…</li>
      <li><em>You cannot use any fresh ingredients like arugula since you wouldn’t be able to freeze it later.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread the cheese on the ham, and then put the topping you want.</li>
      <li>Roll over itself as if it were a rug, then cover in some aluminum foil to make sure it holds the shape; after that, freeze for at least one hour.</li>
      <li>Take out of the freezer and, while it is still cold, cut in little thin wheels.</li>
      <li>Wait for about 20 minutes until they defreeze all the way through and serve.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A very easy recipe and a great finger snack!</p>

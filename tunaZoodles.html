Ready in 10 minutes, this is good in every sense of the word!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>, <em>serves one</em>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium zucchini, spiralized</li>
      <li>½ clove of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ripe tomato</li>
      <li><em>Optional: a small piece of roasted red pepper.</em></li>
      <li>Small drained can of tuna</li>
      <li>Oregano, salt, pepper</li>
      <li>Parmesan or feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Puree the raw tomato with some salt and black pepper, and the roasted pepper if using.</li>
      <li>In a pan, put the garlic very finely minced with about a teaspoon of oil over médium heat. When the garlic starts to turn golden, add the zucchini and cook with salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, until it softens a Little bit.
        <ul>
          <li><em>If it gets overcooked, the zucchini might release water; if this happens, you should take them out of the pan with a fork or something similar to leave the liquid behind.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Serve the zoodles with the tomato sauce, tuna, oregano, cheese and a some good quality olive oil on top.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like to take this in a lunch box, putting the zoodles in a box and the rest of ingredients in a small jar, so I can warm up the zoodles over there, mix everything up, and eat!</p>

These are many different sauces to dip your momos in; however, the one I liked most is the sesame achar, that is the one I had more often in Nepal.</p>

<p>This is the version I have found to be closest to what I remembered. I do hope you enjoy it!</p>

  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>

      <li>2 red chillies, desseded or whole (depending on how spicy you want it)</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>Salt, black pepper</li>

      <li>
        <p>Add the rest of ingredients except the coriander and some water to cover. Turn the heat down to low. <em>Donâ€™t add too much water or the final result will be too runny.</em>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Take out the peel of the tomatoes and then process everything along with the coriander to get a smooth mixture. You can run it through a sieve it you want it to be smoother.

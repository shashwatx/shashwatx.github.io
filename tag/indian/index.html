As I mentioned in [other posts](http://maria.recipes/mathri), I adore indian snacks - I always have so much trouble choosing appetizers at Indian restaurants! Last time I was at one, I had some wonderful pakoras, and I figured perhaps there is a way to make them lower carb... So these babies were born! They still use some chickpea flour like in the original recipe, but in smaller amount to lower carbs. BUT - you can sub the flour for two eggs and just add less water later, no problem, and you will have extremely low carb pakora!

For the nutritional facts, I divided this in four (so each serving will be about 6 small pakora) and made an approximation for the oil absorbed during frying - but there is a good chance the calories will be a bit less since some oil is absorbed in the kitchen papers :)  

If you like my recipes, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe), which will also give you access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* 1,5 cups (100 g) finely shredded cabbage
* 1/2 medium onion (55g), finely chopped
* 2 tbsp chopped coriander
* 1 tsp ginger paste
* 1/4 cup chickpea flour (30 g)
* 1/3 cup ground flax seeds (50g)
* Pinch of stevia (optional)
* Pinch of asafoetida (optional)
* 2 green chilies finely chopped (optional)
* 1/4 tsp red chili powder or to taste
* 1/4 tsp turmeric pwoder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp chaat masala (optional, sub for a little more salt)
* Coconut Oil for frying 

<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. First, mix the vegetables with the coriander, ginger and spices.
  2. Mix in the chickpea flour and the ground flax. 
  3. Add boiling water: start with 1/4 cup and work your way up until you have a mixture that you can form into balls. 
  4. Warm up the coconut oil in a pan and cover a plate with kitchen towels.
  5. Use a tablespoon to scoop small amounts of the batter (I personally form them with my hand) into the hot oil. 
  6. Fry for about 2 minutes until golden and crunchy all over. Then, put on the kitchen towels to absorb any extra oil.
  7. Eat with lots of spicy chutney!

Indian snacks are amazing - but always full of carbs! These crunchy, spicy crackers, however, are very low carb, at 0.5 g net carbs for two pieces. You can customise the spices to suit your preference (perhaps paprika and cumin, to dip in guacamole). Enjoy!

* 1/2 cup Coconut flour (60 g)
* 3 tbsp psyllium husk powder (24 g)
* Spices, crushed together: 1/3 tsp whole cumin, 1/3 tsp carom seeds, 1/3 tsp fenugreek leaves
* 1/8 cup butter or coconut oil for dairy free (30 g)
* 1 egg
* Heaping 1/3 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 tbsp butter (14 g)
* 1/2 cup boiling water (or more)

<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. First, melt the 1/8 cup of butter and then mix in the egg and vinegar. In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients and the spices. 
  2. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and incorporate until you have a crumbly mixture. 
  3. Now add the boiling water: start at 1/3 cup, then increase slowly until you have a slightly sticky dough. 
  4. Knead for about 1 minute, then put onto a parchment paper. 
  5. Use a rolling pin to make a 2-3 mm thick sheet of dough. Then, cut into pieces (I made 40). 
  6. Melt the tbsp of butter, then brush it over the raw mathri. 
  7. Sprinkle with some salt over the top and, optionally, some red chili powder. 
  8. Bake at 180-200? for 35-40 minutes until they are dry and crunchy. If they aren't crunchy yet, you can turn off the oven and leave them inside to dry out.

Finding keto snacks in indian cuisine is quite challenging, as most of them are made with pulses or wheat. So I was very excited to make a keto version of Dhokla, a typical snack from Gujrat. I made it for some guests and they all loved it - and they had no clue it was secretly healthy! 

The ones in the picture are very small, about half the size of the serving listed in the recipe, so feel free to adapt the size of the servings to your needs.

Summer is coming. And that means... ice cream! And my favorite ice cream is Kulfi: an indian milk-based, egg-free ice cream that is usually flavored with cardamom and other ingredients such as saffron (kesar), pistachios or mango. 

Kulfi is usually made with milk, but my low carb version uses heavy cream (or coconut cream for vegans) and almond milk to keep it low carb. It is a bit harder then its high carb version, so I would recommend you make it with a stick (popsicle style) rather than to eat with a spoon. But either way, I am sure you will enjoy it!

And if you like my recipes, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe), which will also give you access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* 2/3 cups of heavy whipping cream or coconut cream (160g), chilled in the fridge
* 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk
* Stevia or erythritol or sucralose
* Seeds from 2 green cardamoms, powdered
* A good pinch of saffron (optional)
* 1/4 tsp xantham gum (optional)
* 30 g of roasted almonds or pistachios (optional)


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Put the almond milk in a small pot. Heat it up until it almost boils (but dont get it there as it could curdle!), then add the spices and sweetener (equivalent to 3-4 tbsp sugar). Let the aromas infuse.
  2. Let the mixture cool.
  3. Whip the cream until it forms peaks. 
  4. Mix the almond milk with the xantham gum (you might have to blend it to avoid lumps), then add it to the whipped cream slowly. 
  5. Once everything is mixed, taste it and add more sweetener if necessary. Then divide into four containers and freeze. 
  6. Serve once frozen with some chopped nuts on top (optional).

One of the most common breakfasts for Indian folks, now in a Keto version. Suitable for vegetarians and vegans, and perfect for those who miss their traditional Indian food. 

And if you like parathas, you can also check out my [broccoli paratha](http://maria.recipes/broccoliParatha), and of course, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe) to get access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* Ingredients for the <a href="http://maria.recipes/flaxRoti">Flax Roti</a>
* 1/2 cup of cauliflower rice (60g)
* 1/8 cup of red onion, chopped (20g)
* 2-3 tbsp chopped coriander
* A pinch of asafoetida (optional)
* 1/4 tsp cumin powder
* 1 green chili, finely chopped
* Red chili powder to taste
* Pinch of garam masala
* Salt to taste (about 1/4 tsp)

<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Prepare the flax roti dough like in the [original recipe](http://maria.recipes/flaxRoti).
  2. Mix all the ingredients for the filling. 
  3. Divide the dough into five and the filling into five. 
  4. Take one piece of dough, divide into two and make two disks that are the same size, as thin as possible (less than 1 mm). 
  5. Put a portion of the stuffing on one of the disks, lightly water the edges, then put the other disk on top. Use the rolling pin to seal the edges, very carefully so it doesnt break. Then, gently roll the whole paratha.
  6. Cook like you would a normal paratha, using 1 tsp of oil.

This is what I call my Lazy Seekh Kebab: just mix up some spices with meat, then cook it in the pan with veggies. No tandoori, no long cooking process, but still incredible flavor!

  6. Cook for about 2 minutes, then turn the kebabs 90 degrees and move the veggies so they don't burn. Proceed until you have done all four sides. 
  7. Serve with some mint chutney.

* **Process**
  1. Mix all the ingredients except the paneer. Then add the paneer and let it marinate for at least an hour, preferably overnight, in the fridge.
  2. You can make this in the oven, but I like to cook it over high heat with the oil until very brown and crispy. 
  3. Sprinkle with coriander leaves and serve.

_For those who miss dumplings... this is your recipe!_

Momos are steamed dumplings made in Tibet and Nepal, and very popular as a snack in India. They are usually made with a white flour dough and served with very spicy sauce; I actually have the traditional recipe in one of my oldest posts, from back when I ate low fat high carb... 

So now I decided to make a new, improved, low carb version! The filling is made with chicken, buttter and zucchini; I like the zucchini to add some extra moisture, but you can leave it out and increase the chicken and butter to make an even more keto version. The dough is made mixing ground sesame seeds, psyllium husk and coconut flour (you can use all coconut flour following the recipe for my [coconut flour roti](http://maria.recipes/coconutRoti) but I didn't want my momo to taste like coconut!). I almost didn't upload these because they turned out purple... but I read that this can be caused by the psyllium husk and it can depend on the brand. And even if they come out purple, these are delicious!

  <li>75 g minced chicken</li>
  <li>25 g shredded zucchini</li>
  <li>1 tbsp(15 g) butter</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/8 tsp ground fenugreek (methi)</li>
  <li>Optional: pinch of chili to taste</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp ground ginger</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp ground garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground onion</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped scallions (10 g)</li>
  <li>55 g ground sesame seeds</li>
  <li>2 tsp oil</li>
  <li>3,5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (28 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup (15 g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a></li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Mix the ingredients for the filling: chicken, butter, zucchini, spices, soy sauce and 1/8 tsp salt. If you want to check for salt, take a small amount of the filling and cook in a pan, then taste it. 
  2. Mix the ground sesame, <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> and 1/4 tsp salt. Then add the oil and water, starting with 1/4 cup of water and adding more little by little until you have a dough you can shape. 
  3. Take a piece of dough slightly smaller than a goldball. With a rolling pin, roll it to 2-3 mm thick; you can add a bit of water if the dough is dry and crumbling. Then trim the edges to make a 10 cm diameter disk. 
  4. Put a teaspoon of filling in the centre and then form the momo as seen in the video. 
  5. Once all the momos are formed, steam them for about 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked inside.
  6. Serve with spicy chutney, like [this one](http://maria.recipes/acharEng)!

A simple, 5 ingredient recipe to make broccoli parathas stuffed with cream cheese. They are amazing with some pickle for breakfast! And if you are vegan, you can use some almond cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese. 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 bunch of broccoli (250 g)</li>
  <li>3,5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (28 g)</li>
  <li>A big pinch of salt</li>
  <li>8 tbsp (120g) cream cheese (you can substitute for paneer if you want)</li>
  <li>4 tsp ghee</li>
  <li>Spices to taste (optional)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Cook the broccoli (boil or steam) until fork tender, without overcooking so it doesnt lose the green color.
  2. Blend the broccoli with 2 tbsp water. 
  3. Add the <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> and salt to the broccoli puree, along with other spices if you want (some garlic powder and onion powder could be great!) and mix until you have a dough. 
  4. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. 
  5. Using a chakla or a rolling pin (i like to cover my surface with plastic wrap to avoid any stickiness - by putting a bit of water on the surface first, the plastic wrap won't move when you roll), roll each part into a very thin disk of about 1 mm thickness. 
  6. Take a disk, spread 2 tbsp cheese on it, then put another disk on top. Pinch the edges to seal. 
  7. Melt 1 tsp of ghee on a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook the paratha for 3-4 minutes on one side until it is brown, then filp and cook further 2-3 minutes. 
  8. Cook all four parathas this way and serve with a low carb pickle.

When people think of indian food, they very rarely think of fish dishes, but in certain parts of the country like Bengal or Mumbai, fish curries are a staple in every household. This one in particular is my favorite, as the coconut milk makes for a super creamy sauce.

<ul>
  <li>500 g cod or other similar fish, cut in chunks</li>
  <li>3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 dried red chili (or one green chili chopped to be added with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
  <li>1/2 medium onion (50 g)</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (150 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garlic paste or 4 cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>3/4 cups coconut milk</li>
  <li>Optional: 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander to garnish</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil in a pan over medium high heat. Fry the mustard seeds and dried red chili.
  2. When the seeds start to pop, wait about one minute, then add the garlic, ginger and onions with a bit of salt. Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes until they are translucent.
  3. Add the chopped tomatoes with salt. Cook for 5 minutes until they break down. 
  4. Add the fish with the rest of the salt. 
  5. Turn up the stove to high heat to cook the fish for about 2 minutes. Add the spices. Mix and cook for 30 seconds, then add the coconut milk.
  6. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Turn off the stove, add vinegar or lemon juice, garnish with coriander and serve.

I don't know why bhindi (okra) is not as popular as other low-carb vegetables. It has only 4.3 g net carbs for 100 grams and it  truly is delicious! The only thing you have to remember is to cook it properly to get rid of the slimy texture inside, so beware of that! 

<ul>
  <li>2,5 cups of bhindi/okra (250 g)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil: I use 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> and 1 tbsp mustard oil</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium onion)</li>
  <li>100 g fresh tomato (1/2 medium)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 dried red chili, or one green chili (if using fresh: chop and add with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>Dried spices: 1/3 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp dried fenugreek leaves</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the coconut oil and use it to fry the chopped bhindi. This should take at least 15 minutes, until the slime disappears. It is a very important step, as otherwise you will end up with a slimy, gross curry!
  2. Take out the bhindi and keep for later. Add the rest of the oil (I used mustard oil) and add the cumin and dried red chilli. 
  3. When the cumin starts to pop, cook for about 30 seconds, then add the onion, garlic and ginger, with a bit of salt. Cook for 5-10 minutes until it is soft. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and spices (except the fenugreek leaves). Cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are broken down.
  5. Now put the bhindi back in the pan, add salt and 1/2 cup of water and cook covered on low heat for about 5-10 minutes. If there is too much liquid, cook it without the lid.
  6. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves and coriander, as well as some lemon juice (optional) and serve.

A simple recipe for a low-carb, lactovegetarian breakfast, for a good boost of fiber in the morning. 

<ul>
  <li>100 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>1 flax egg: 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground + 3 tbsp warm water</li>
  <li>1 cup (70g) shredded cabbage</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped green onions</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, prepare your flax egg and let it sit for a couple of minutes. 
  2. Add the paneer to the flax egg and mix until you have a sticky paste. You can add a bit of water if needed. 
  3. Add salt, pepper and the vegetables and mix. Then divide into three. 
  4. Put 1/3 tbsp coconut oil in a pan and use it to fry one of the patties, about 3 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes after flipping. 
  5. Proceed with the other two parts of the mixture and serve.

This is the indian version of scrambled tofu: crumbled paneer with vegetables and spices. A very filling meal full of protein that takes 10 minutes from start to finish. A must try!

<ul>
  <li>250 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium), chopped</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (100g), chopped</li>
  <li>Other vegetables to taste (like green peas), optional</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/4 tsp whole cumin</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp garam masala or more to taste</li> 
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>  
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, if the crumbled paneer is too dry, add a little bit of warm water to rehydrate it.
  2. Melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds until they start popping. Then, add the onion with some salt and cook for 5 minutes until they are brown.
  3. Once the onion is cooked, add the ginger and garlic. Cook for a minute. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and salt. Cook for two minutes until they the tomatoes are soft, then add the other spices. Mix well. 
  5. Add the paneer (drained if you were soaking it). Cook for 30-60 seconds. Add the kasuri methi if you are using it.
  6. Garnish with lemon juice and coriander.

Paneer is indian cottage cheese, one of the basic protein sources for vegetarian curries. You can use it in blocks in tikka or gravies, or you can crumble it for egg-free hash browns or bhurji. 

The nutritional info may not be 100% accurate as I estimated using packaged paneer. The more it is drained, the lower carb it will be.

<ul>
  <li>2 L (8 cups) whole fat milk</li>
  <li>1/4 cup lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy bottom saucepan.
  2. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice, stirring constantly until it curdles and the whey has separated completely.
  3. Using a very fine sieve or a cheese cloth, separate the curds from the whey. You can keep the whey for something different (it has some protein, but also carbs, so not keto-friendly!). 
  4. Drain the curd well and use it fresh, or put it with some weight on top to form a firm block.

Easiest recipe for a delicious Chicken Curry. It won't be as good as the recipes that use real indian spices and blends... but it is pretty darn good anyway :) 

<ul>
  <li>8 chicken drumsticks, with skin and bone (1 kg)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/2 big onion or one medium (110g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or one big clove of garlic</li>
  <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
  <li>1 cup of coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/4-1 cup of water depending on desired sauce</li>
  <li><i>Optional:coriander to garnish</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. In a pot or a pressure cooker, in two batches, sear the meat (with some salt) for about 3 minutes, using 1 tbsp oil per batch. Set the seared drumsticks aside. 
  2. Pur√©e the onion, ginger and garlic. 
  3. Heat up the other 2 tbsp oil and fry the onion paste, with salt and pepper, over medium heat for about 10 minutes until it smells sweet. 
  4. Add the curry powder. Cook for 60 seconds, then add the coconut milk and water (add water depending on how thick you want your sauce; add more water if you will be cooking on an open pot). Mix well until the sauce is even. 
  5. When it comes to a boil, add the chicken back in. Now cook on an open flame on low heat for about 45-60 minutes or in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes until the meat is tender. 
  6. Garnish with coriander and serve.

It had been so long since I published any indian food! This is one of my favorite veg curries. It is sweet with a slightly acid touch thanks to the mango powder (that can be substituted for lemon), and is awesome with some dal and rice or roti.


<ul>
  <li>500 g pumpkin or butternut squash</li>
  <li>Dried red chili (1-2)</li>
  <li>100 g onion</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida (can be subbed for 1/2 tsp garlic paste, that would be used with the ginger)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, to serve</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil (mustard or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or 1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Stevia or sweetener to taste (equivalent to 1 tsp sugar)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil. Fry the fenugreek seeds, chili and asafoetida for 2 minutes (don't burn them!!!).
  2. Add the ginger. Cook for 1 minute, then add the onion and salt. Cook on slow heat for about 10 minutes, until it is brown and soft. 
  3. Add the pumpkin and spices (except amchoor) and some more salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Then, pour 1/4 cup water and cover.
  4. Cook on low heat. Once the pumpkin is soft, add the rest of the ingredients, mix and serve.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/403/31699704665_590bb3e042_o_d.jpg" />

This is an indian appetizer from the region of Gujarat: vegan savory pancakes made with moong lentils, and filled with anything you like. They can be had plain with chutney, or filled with paneer (like I did), tomato onion and coriander, or whatever you fancy. 
They are usually had with tea in the afternoon, but I like them as a lunch or dinner appetizer: they are light, full of protein and everybody likes them, even the biggest of carnivores!


<ul>
  <li>1/2 moong dal, preferibly peeled (100 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp asafoetida (you can substitute it with 1/2 clove of garlic, smashed into a paste)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt </li>
  <li>Chilli to taste (preferibly green chili paste)</li>
  <li>A few drops of stevia (equivalent to 2 tsp sugar)</li>
  <li>50 g paneer (or cottage cheese)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp Chaat masala (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp fresh coriander</li>
  <li>2 tsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> (for cooking)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash the lentils properly, then soak them for 3-4 hours. 
  2. Drain, add 3 tbsp water and grind into a fine paste. If necessary you can add more water. You should end up with a pancake-like batter. 
  3. Add the salt, baking soda, asafoetida and stevia and mix well. 
  4. Lightly grease a pan or tawa (with 1/2 tsp oil per chilla it is usually enough) and put it over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 of the batter and use a spatula to make a thin disk of about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Put the filling on top while it cooks; in this case, paneer, coriander and a bit of chaat masala. 
  6. When the batter starts to dry in the top (about 2-3 minutes), flip it, cook another minute, flip again and fold it in half to keep the filling inside. Proceed with the other chilla. 
  7. Serve them with more paneer, coriander, chaat masala, tomato and onion, or with your favorite chutney.

I love this curry and its aromatic, thick sauce. It's a real crowd-pleaser. The traditional way of making it takes forever, but I used [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1qXKTbqOM) as reference, since it is easier and takes "only" one hour to make. 

For the sauce you can use cashews, which make it creamier, but I used almonds to lower the carbs in the recipe.

Eat it with rice, naan or, in my case, salad and cauli-rice :D 


<ul>
  <li>325 g white onion</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2 cm ginger or 1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp oil (I used mustard oil)</li>
  <li>420 g chicken breast (you could use drumsticks instead; it will be even better!)</li>
  <li>30 whole, peeled almonds (40-45g), soaked in water for 24h</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut milk</li>
  <li>3/4 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>5 cm cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>10 cloves</li>
  <li>10 green cardamom</li>
  <li>3 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1-1.5 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: some sugar or stevia, if you want the sauce to be sweet.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, blend the ingredients for the onion pur√©e until smooth: onions, garlic, ginger. Separately, form the almond paste, blending the almonds, 3 tbsp coconut milk and 3 tbsp water.
  2. In a pan, heat up the oil and fry the whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick) 2 minutes, without burning them. 
  3. Add the onion pur√©e and a bit of salt and cook, stirring often, for about 15 minutes on medium-high. Be careful not to let it stick to the bottom of the pan. 
  4. Meanwhile, cube the chicken (if using drumsticks, leave them whole) and blend the ingredients for the almond paste.
  5. Once the onion has formed a pretty dry paste, take off the stove and add the ground spices. Cook for about a minute. Then, add in the chicken with some salt and brown for 5 minutes.
  6. Pour the coconut milk and 3/4 cup of water and mix well to form a thick sauce. Lower the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Add more water if it starts to get dry.  
  7. Finally, add the almond paste and the garam masala and mix. Add more water if you want a thinner sauce. Let everything boil for a couple of minutes and serve.

Since going keto two weeks ago I have been craving good indian food. Unfortunately, dal chawal (lentil curry with rice) is not really keto-friendly, so an egg curry with some salad and/or cauli-rice seemed like a good enough substitute!

This is more of a pattern to make a very easy egg curry. I usually just add more or less spices depending on how I am feeling that day, so feel free to change the amounts and/or add other spices or ingredients - maybe amchoor, some chunks of red bell pepper... Experiment!

<ul> 
    <li>18 boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    <li>400 g tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>300 g onions, chopped</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>An inch of ginger, chopped (or 1 tsp ginger paste)</li>
    <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 tbsp oil (I am using mustard oil)</li>
    <li>Optional: sugar or sweetener of choice</li> 
    <li>1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream (6-g) (you can sub for greek yogurt or coconut milk)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat the oil in a saucepan, then add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat until they are quite soft. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes for the raw smell to go away. 
  3. Add the spices and cook for 1 minute. If it's too dry and you are scared they will burn, add some water. 
  4. Add the tomatoes, salt and tomato paste. Cover and cook on low for about 10-15 minutes, until the tomatoes are very soft. 
  5. _Optional step: you can fry the peeled eggs for a couple of minutes with some oil; this gets them slightly crunchy outside._
  6. Once the tomatoes are soft, blend the sauce and add the yogurt and sugar. Add some water if the sauce is too thick.
  7. Put it back into the stove, add the eggs (whole or cut in half), let them boil together for a couple of minutes and serve with some fresh coriander.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/316/31326178640_1525979703_o_d.jpg" />

This is one of my hostess' specialty, vegetable pulao, for 4-5 people. An easy one-dish meal that can be slightly changed and always comes out equally delicious. You can use chatever vegetables you ike, such as green peas, broccoli cauliflower, potatoes, red capsisum...


<ul>
  <li>Vegetables, chopped: 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1/2 green capsicum pepper, handful of green beans, green chili to taste.</li>
  <li>_Optional, to add more protein: textured soy protein, soaked_</li>
  <li>Whole masala: 4 bay leaves, 4 green cardamoms crushed, 2 black cardamom, 4-5 cm stick of cinnamon, 10 cloves, 12 black peppercorns + 10 small whole garlic cloves</li>
  <li>Rice: about a cup (roughly the same volume as the vegetables), rinsed</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>Red chili to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek leaves (optional)</li>
  <li>Sugar to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1-2 tsp salt, in total</li>
  <li>Optional: yoghurt or curd (especially good for leftovers!)</li>
  <li> To garnish: coriander (about 1/2 cup), lemon juice, mint (usually saved for meat pulaos)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan with 3-4 tbsp oil (or less, if you are fat-conscious), add the whole masala and brown them on low heat.
  2. Add the onions and cook them for 15-20 minutes, until they are super brown and caramelised and delicious.
  3. Add the carrots and cook them for a couple of minutes to avoid them being raw in the end. Then, add all the other veggies. Cook and cover until slightly soft, on low heat.
  4. Add the soy meat, salt and spices and mix thoroughly. After a couple of minutes, add the rice, mix, add the turmeric, and mix again.
  5. Now, you can either add some water and fresh coriander and cook it without a lid, or pressure cook it for 2 whistles on high flame.
  6. Once the rice is cooked through, fluff up with a fork, garnish with some more coriander, and enjoy.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/609/31552398312_4d6638dcdd_o_d.jpg" />


While in India I visited Bangalore. In indian restaurants in Europe the food that is mostly served is North Indian. However, south indian cuisine has so much variety and uses such different flavours when compared to North Indian! 

In this case, I was taught how to make Bisi Bele Bath, a wonderful south indian dish for the rainy season. It is usually a one-pot meal, the perfect comfort food to have in a cozy evening, enough to serve 6 people. 

The friend that taught this to me tweaks the recipe a little bit, mixing different dals and using two pots instead of one. However, if you want to go for the most traditional version, use only toor dal and rice (it can be cooked in the same pot and at the same time as the rice), and skip the tadka; this will make for an easier one-pot meal.


<ul>
  <li>2 cup of mixed dal</li>
  <li>3 fistfuls of rice and 2 of broken wheat (you can use all rice for the traditional version, about 1.5 cups)</li>
  <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
  <li>_Optional: 2 tomatoes, chopped_</li>
  <li>4-5 small shallots, peeled and whole, or a few pieces of green capsicum</li>
  <li>_Optional: a few green beans, chopped_</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li>1/2-1 tbsp tamarind paste (if you dont have any, you can use lemon juice instead)</li>
  <li>5-6 tbsp of bisibelebath masala mixture OR: 1.5 tbsp coriander powder, 1 tbsp black gram dal powder, 2-3 tsp chili powder, 1-1.5 tsp cumin powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp fenugreek powder, 3-4 cloves and a few curry leaves</li>
  <li>For the tadka (optional): pinch of asafoetida, dried red chilies to taste, a bunch of curry leaves, 1 tsp black mustard seeds, 1-2 tbsp roasted bengal gram (optional) or cashews, vegetable oil</li>
  <li>_Optional: jaggery or sugar to taste, cashew nuts (if not used in tadka)_</li>
  <li>_Optional: fresh coriander to garnish_</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash and rinse the dal a couple of times. Tren, soak for at least 4 hours. 
  2. In a fast cooker,pour the dal with its soaking water, then add some salt, asafoetida, turmeric, shallots and carrots. Close the lid and let it whistle about 3 times or until it smells like the dal is cooked. 
  3. Meanwhile, rinse the rice and broken wheat properly. Then, put it in a pot with salted water and boil until cooked.
  4. Now, mix the cooked dal and rice in the pot where you cooked the rice in and add the tomatoes. 
  5. Once the tomatoes are soft, add the bisibelebath masala. Mix well and cook together for a couple of minutes. Add water if it is too thick. 
  6. Add the tamarind into the mixture. Then, taste for salt and sweetness. 
  7. Finally (optionally), make the tadka. Heat up 2-3 tbsp of oil in a small pan and fry the whole spices until brown in this order: asafoetida, mustard seeds, chillies, bengal gram and curry leaves. Once it is done, add it into the pot and put a lid on it for the aromas to infuse. 
  8. Mix everything and serve.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/608/31698792525_4c207670e9_o_d.jpg" />

Chowmein is an indo-chinese dish, very typical from Nepal: streetfood served often in doubtious places, but delicious!  

Normally this would use whole-wheat noodles, but I decided to substitute them for spiralized vegetables. I am using turnips, but you could use other white vegetables. It also usually has carrot but I am avoiding it to keep it low-carb. 

The most popular ones are Veg Chowmein (vegetarian) and Chicken Chowmein (chicken), although other types of meat can be used, or shrimp or egg. I sometimes make it using tofu (to have some protein but keep it vegan), but whoever wants to can add the meat or shrimp along with the vegetables so they fry together. And of course, quantities are just to orientate you, and can be adapted!

This is a strong and tasty dish, spicy and slightly sweet, perfect for 3-4 people. I hope you like it.

<ul>
  <li>3 spiralized turnips, 360g (or you can substitute for whole-wheat noodles)</li>
  <li>1/4 cabbage (300g), thinly sliced (you can use the spiralizer for this!)</li>
  <li>1/2 red bell pepper (60g), cut in trips</li>
  <li>1 medium red onion (100g)</li>
  <li>Other optional vegetables, such as a handful of boiled green beans</li>
  <li>250 g firm tofu (optional)</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves very finely chopped or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>Strips of fresh ginger (that should be added with the other vegetables) or 2 tsp ginger paste (that would be added with the garlic)</li>
  <li>3 eggs (optional)</li>
  <li>Optional: spring onions, for garnishing</li>
  <li>4 tsp soy sauce (half could be substituted for oyster sauce, for non-vegetarian people)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp red chili paste or red chili powder (this should be adapted to taste; 1 tsp is very spicy)</li>
  <li>Salt. </li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tsp rice vinager, lime juice, or something similar</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut oil</li>
  <li>To serve: ketchup and chili sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a big enough pan, over medium-high heat, put a tablespoon of oil and then fry the cubed tofu until golden, for about 5 minutes. Later, take it out and put aside for later. 
  2. Pour the rest of the oil in the pan and add the onion. Let them cook for 5 minutes. When they start to turn translucent, add the rest of the vegetables and cook until tender.
  3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes so it loses the raw flavor.
  4. Add the vegetable "noodles", mix well and then pour the sauce over everything.
  5. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the "noodles" are tender. Check for salt. 
  6. Serve with some k√©tchup and chili sauce on top.

Chicken Tikka Masala (that can also be made with paneer or tofu to keep it vegetarian) is one of the most typical dishes in indian restaurants. It has a thick onion and tomato sauce, spicy with a sweet touch, that is always a hit. 

On top of that, it is easier to make than it seems. It doesn't require many ingredients, and it always comes out great. Try it!



<ul>
  <li>700 g chicken or paneer tikka</li> 
  <li>4 peeled tomatoes (450 g or 3 cups)</li>
  <li>1 chopped medium onion (110g)</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped, or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>2'5 cm minced ginger or 1.5 tsp ginger paste <i>(use 2/3 of the amount if making paneer or tofu tikka masala)</i></li>
  <li>Stevia to taste (equivalent to 2 tbsp brown sugar)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili or to taste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil or ghee</li>
  <li>Optional: 4 tbsp heavy cream (or yoghurt). <i>(You can substitute it for coconut milk if you want a vegan Tikka Masala.)</i></li> 
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil and fry the onions for 5 min.
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 min.
  3. Add the spices and mix around, cooking it for 30 seg.
  4. Add the rest of the ingredients, cover and cook on low heat for 20 min.
  5. Take off the heat and process the sauce until smooth. Add the cream or yoghurt, and then the chicken or paneer tikka.
  6. Let everything boil together for a few minutes and serve with pilao rice.

Chicken tikka, that can also be made with paneer or tofu, is an easy to make appetizer, very versatile to add to other dishes, or to just eat it plain.

I like to make it with big chunks of onion and red bell pepper, to have more color and different flavors. 

It is good as it is, in salad or sandwiches, and it is also the base for the typical dish Chicken Tikka Masala, one of the most popular foods at indian restaurants. 


<ul>
  <li>2 big chicken breasts (600g), cubed, or 500 g paneer or firm tofu, cubed</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (125g) greek-style yoghurt. <i>Use vegan yoghurt and tofu for a vegan dish</i></li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili or to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp ginger paste, 1 tbsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 onion and 1/2 red bell pepper, in big chunks</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and marinate for at least 2 hours.
  2. Put the meat, onion and pepper into skewers and on an oven tray. (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for a couple of hours and then cover the part that doesn't have meat with some aluminum foil).
   - Another option, instead of making it in the oven, is to make it in a pan over high heat with some oil, without skewers.
  3. Put under the grill for 20 min turning it every 5 and pouring some of the marination sauce on top if it dries out.
  4. Once it starts getting slightly burnt in the corners, it is done.
  5. Use for tikka masala, pizza, sandwiches, salad...

This is a dish that my bae and I love. He is usually not a big fan of vegetables, but when I make this, it disappears in no time! And I love it too not just because of the flavour, but because it takes very little time to make (the most annoying part is chopping the vegetables!).

The final result is very good, and combines wonderfully with some plain basmati rice. For those who want to, sometimes I like to add some pan-fried paneer or tofu to have some more protein in my meal. 

An easy and  yummy curry, it's worth trying!


<ul>
  <li>250 g sliced mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 medium brown onion (110g), finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 medium-sized tomato (140g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp powdered chili (or to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</li>
  <li>Lemon juice: 1 tbsp or to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh coriander to garnish</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, add the onion with a bit of salt and brown them for about 5 minutes. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and let them cook for 1-2 minutes, so they loose their "raw" flavour. 
  3. Turn down the heat and add the powdered spices and let them roast for about a minute to become more fragrant (if the pan is too dry and the spices might burn, add a bit of water). 
  4. Add the mushrooms with a bit of salt, mix, turn the heat to medium and cover. 
  5. Cook stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are almost cooked. 
  6. Add the tomato and the tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes until the tomato is broken down. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves crushing them between your fingers, add some lemon juice and serve. If you like, you can garnish with some coriander, too!

These are many different sauces to dip your momos in; however, the one I liked most is the sesame achar, that is the one I had more often in Nepal. 

This is the version I have found to be closest to what I remembered. I do hope you enjoy it!


<ul>
  <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
  <li>1 onion</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2 red chillies, desseded or whole (depending on how spicy you want it)</li>
  <li>2 tomatoes</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp sugar or stevia to taste</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 cup fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. In a casserole, warm up some oil with the sesame seeds. 
  2. Add the onions, garlic, ginger and chilli and brown for about 5 minutes.
  3. Add the rest of ingredients except the coriander and some water to cover. Turn the heat down to low. _Don't add too much water or the final result will be too runny._
  4. Simmer until the vegetables are broken down. 
  5. Take out the peel of the tomatoes and then process everything along with the coriander to get a smooth mixture. You can run it through a sieve it you want it to be smoother.

When I went to Nepal a few years ago, I adored it; the country, the people, the ricefields, the mountains... and the food. Every day we would have dal bhat and chai; we loved it. But as soon as we got a chance... we would go to a restaurant and order a nice plate of momos. These are dumplings, that are usually steamed or fried, and that are available in so many flavours: veg, chicken, buffalo, paneer... (when I was looking for recipes, I even found a chocolate one!!)


Ever since, I have been looking for a good recipe of both, the momo and the sauce that comes with it, "achar", because the one they made over there (with tomato and sesame seeds), I couldnt seem to find in european restaurants... And now, at last, I am proud of the result I got! I'm not going to lie here, it is a lot of work; but at least it doesn't require any fancy ingredients, and if you make a bigger amount, you can freeze the raw momo and then cook them straight out of the freezer! Momo all year round!!! :)



<ul>
  <li>200 g chicken meat, minced</li>
  <li>150 g zucchini, grated (about half a zucchini)</li>
  <li>1/4 red onion, very finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 scallions, very finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp ground fenugreek seeds</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp ground chili</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp powdered garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp powdered ginger</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp sugar</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt (depends on how salty your soy sauce is)</li>
</ul>


* **Making the filling**
  * Just mince everything up and mix it together. Let it sit for a while in the fridge before cooking. 

* **For the wrappers**
  * Some people use wonton wrappers or similar store-bought wrappers; if you cannot find them, make a basic dough with flour, salt and water (like the chapati dough)
  * You should use disks of about 8-10 cm diameter, preferably slightly thicker in the center than in the edges. You will need around 25. 

* **For forming the momos**
  * Patience, my friend. 

* **For cooking the momos**, there are two ways:
  * Steaming the momos, for about 10 minutes
  * Deep fry them (I cannot say for how long since I have never fried them myself)

Serve them warm with a spicy sauce - preferably a tomato and sesame "achar" like [this one!](http://maria.recipes/acharEng). Delicious!

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src= "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/273/31698838425_d6a909cc53_o_d.jpg" />

One of my favourite vegetarian foods is palak paneer, a spinach and cheese curry. There is only one minor problem with it, and it is precisely one of its key ingredients: Paneer.

Don't get me wrong. I love it. But I cannot seem to be able to find it in stores, trying to replace it with other cheeses just leads to weird-looking attempts at the recipe, and making the paneer myself... well. has anyone tried to make paneer from scratch on a busy week?
Um... not very practical. 

So, the ultimate way to make palak paneer is to not make palak paneer at all, but to make palak TOFU. Yup, you read that right. Tofu actually has quite a neutral flavour that works very well with the spices of the dish, it holds its shape properly, gives nice texture and colour, and from a nutritional point of view, I quite prefer it to the paneer. 

I know this may sound strange, but seriously: my lovely indian boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, and he was so impressed that I had actually taken the time to make the paneer from scratch... it was only after several times of making it that I told him it was tofu! 


<ul>
  <li>300 g paneer or tofu (if using tofu: freeze and defreeze so it firms up)</li>
  <li>450 g frozen chopped spinach</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil (3 if using tofu)</li>
  <li>1/2 big onion,  finely chopped (75 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or 2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 green chili, desseded and sliced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 bay leafs or 1 big indian bay leaf</li> 
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp red chili powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp heavy whipping cream (4 tbsp if using tofu)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dry fenugreek leaves (you can leave it out and maybe add 1&2 tsp cinnamon and garnish with coriander, but the flavor will be very different)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cook the spinach according to the package instructions (I cook mine in the microwave). 
  2. In a pan, put some oil (1/2-1 tbsp) with the whole spices and the chili. Once they start warming up, add the garlic, ginger and onion, with a pinch of salt. 
  3. Brown in the pan for about 10 minutes until the onion is tender. Then, add the powdered spices and cook for one minute. 
  4. Add the spinach with some water and salt. Let cook for 5 minutes. 
  5. Add the tofu and let cook together for a couple of minutes. 
  6. Let it cook until the water has evaporated to the consistency of the gravy you like. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the yoghurt and the fenugreek leaves and serve.

Kulfi a creamy indian ice-cream made with milk that can come in different flavors. The most popular, and my boyfriend and I's favorite, is Pista Kulfi: kulfi with pieces of pistachio. It will not disappoint you!

<ul>
  <li>1.5 cups evaporated milk</li>
  <li>3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
  <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
  <li>1/4 cup milk powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp pistachios, coarsely ground</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cardamom powder (seeds from 3 pods)</li>
  <li>Optional: 10-12 saffron threads, 1 tbsp warm milk</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a heavy bottom pan, put all the milk and the cardamom. Bring to a boil, reduce the flame and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
  2. Meanwhile, soak the saffron in a tablespoon of warm milk.
  3. Once the milk has reduced a bit, turn off the stove and add the pistachios and saffron and let it cool down.
  4. Freeze at least 8 hours in individual cups (makes 4-5 big kulfis).
  5. Garnish with chopped pistachios, rose syrup or enjoy it plain!

This is a very typical indian entr√©e, that can be made with chicken, paneer, or even vegetables like mushrooms. I like to have it as a main course with a big green salad with lots of olive oil, as well as some fresh tomato, red onions and coriander.

<ul>
  <li>200 g cooked rice</li>
  <li>50 g flour</li>
  <li>50 g yogurt</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste (1/4 tsp)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Put all the ingredients in a container. 
  2. Add about 1/4 cup of water and blend. Add more water a bit at a time.
  3. Blend until you get a smooth consistency, like crepe batter.
  4. Let it sit for 10 minutes. 
  5. In a nonstick pan on medium-high heat, slightly greased, pour a splash of the batter. 
  6. Tilt the pan to the sides so the batter distributes properly.
  7. Leave 1-2 minutes on that side and then flip over with a espatula.
     - Be careful in this step because dosas could break.
     - If it does break, pour a little bit of batter on the crack and let it set.
  8. Cook on the other side for two more minutes and transfer into a plate.

Serve plain with chutney or stuff it!

<ul>
  <li>1 cup dal (dry lentils); I like using red lentils, which cook fast</li>
  <li>3 onions</li>
  <li>Optional: tomato, peppers or any veggies lying around the kitchen</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh green chillies to taste (I use 3)</li>
  <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste (about 2 garlic cloves)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tsp  garam masala (to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Optional, to garnish: lemon, fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. En a casserole, put water with a pinch of turmeric and the dal; once boiling, cover and simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally.
  2. Meanwhile, in a pan, add some oil and the cumin seeds. 
  3. Once the cumin is golden, add the chili and onions (and any other vegetable you might use that takes long to cook).
  4. Cook on medium heat until the onion is tender. 
  5. Add the garlic and the ginger paste and cook stirring for a minute.
  6. Add the other spices.
     * _At this point you could add soft vegetables such as tomatoes and let them cook for a couple of minutes._
  7. Cook about 30 sec-1 min, then turn off the heat. 
  8. During this time, the dal should've been cooking; the simmering time depends on the type of lentil and your taste (30-60min)
     * _I don't mind if my dal stil has some texture to it, but if you leave it long enough, it will form a puree like in the video_
     * _If the dal is too liquid, turn up the heat and cook uncovered a couple of minutes; if it's too dense, add a splash of water._
  9. Mix in the vegetables with the dal and cook together for 5-10 minutes.

Serve with a splash of lemon juice and some fresh coriander.

This is a very popular snack from Gujrat: a savory spongecake made with chickpeas.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup chana dal / chickpeas - soaked overnight</li>
  <li>3 tbsp yogurt (best if left overnight outside of the fridge so it is more sour)</li>
  <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 tbsp green chili-ginger paste or 2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 cup water _start with half, then add slowly</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/8 tsp turmeric (but if you use too much, the dhokla might end up pink!)</li>
  <li>1'5 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>For the tadka: 1 tbsp oil, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 1 tsp sesame seeds , red chili to taste, Opcional:asafoetida, 2 tbsp water, 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice , Optional: 4 seedless green chillies cut lenghtwise, curry leaves</li>
  <li>To serve: 1 tbsp coconut (better if fresh), fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**

1. Drain the soaked chickpeas, put in a food processor, add half a cup of water and the yogurt and process until you have a thick but smooth batter. Add water (a little at a time) if necessary. Then, let the batter outside in a warm place for 5-6 hours (you should see some bubbles appear).
2. Add the lemon, salat, ginger and turmeric to the fermented mixture. Mix.
3. Grease the mold you will be using (one big round one or two small square ones).
4. Add the baking soda (from now on you have to be fast as the reaction has already started), mix VERY well and pour on a mold.
5. Microwave for 4 minutes (I used two different molds and microwaved them separately) until set, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Original version: steam for about 10-15 minutes
6. Meanwhile, prepare the tadka: first fry the mustard seeds in the oil; when they start to pop add the sesame, take off the stove, add the asafoetida, let it cool down, then add the other ingredients.
7. Once it has set, pout the tadka over the top with a spoon so it is well distributed.
8. To finish, sprinkle the coconut and coriander over the top.

* Serve in squares with your favorite chutney (mint, tamarind or green chutney)

<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
  <li>2-3 green chillies / dried red chillies</li>
  <li>1/2 a lemon, squeezed (1 tbsp lemon juice)</li>
  <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 inch piece cinnamon</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 black cardamom</li>
  <li>2 tsp roasted cumin powder (dry roast in a pan for about 5 minutes, then powder)</li>
  <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cup black tea (let the tea bag in the hot water for 3 minutes)</li>
  <li>2 roma tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/4 cup onion, chopped (plus extra for garnishing)</li>
  <li>2 cans canned chickpeas/ garbanzo beans, drained and washed - about 500-600 grams</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
</ul>
* **Process**

  1. In a big enough saucepan, heat the oil. Add in the cinnamon, bay leaves, black cardamom and cumin seeds (and dried red chillies if using any). 
  2. Cook for 30 seconds until the aroma develops.
  3. Add the ginger, garlic and green chillies. Cook stirring for 30 seconds.
  4. Add the onions and cook on medium heat, covered, until soft.
  5. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5-10 minutes.
  6. Pour the tea and the chickpeas into the pan. Add salt to taste and the rest of spices. 
  7. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
  8. Add the lemon juice, test to adjust seasoning. 
  9. Mix the coriander leaves, garnish with raw onion and serve with lemon slices.

_The best to use is red onion for the garnishing; if non available, I recommend leaving them in cold water for 10 minutes so their taste gets milder._

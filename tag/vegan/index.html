My new favorite breakfast when I am running short of time. This smoothie is seriously amazing!

For the protein powder, you can either use a neutral flavor one (and add some stevia and vanilla extract to the smoothie) or use half vanilla flavor, half neutral flavor.

* 1/2 cup strawberries (75 g)
* 1 scoop of protein powder
* 1 tbsp chia seeds
* 1 tbsp MCT oil
* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* A few mint leaves


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Blend everything until very nice, smooth and pink. 
  2. Drink up!

Fried rice is such a delicious main or side dish to have, but completely out of the question in a keto diet. But today I bring you a keto fried rice, with a special ingredient that will boost your protein and fat intake and make this a great option for vegan ketoers!

<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup <a href="http://amzn.to/2nKbesg">hemp hearts</a> (47 g)</li>
  <li>1 cup of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a> (120 g)</li>

  <li>2 tbsp or 1 medium green onion (scallions), separating white and green part (15 g)</li>

<i>Making low carb bread can be a real challenge for vegans, as most keto breads are heavily egg based. I am afraid I found very few options for vegan keto breads, but I have tried most of the ones in this roundup and they will not let you down! </i>

And last but not least – the next recipes are probably the most bread-like, BUT they use vital wheat gluten, which might be a problem for some. I however sometimes use gluten for sausages or for bread and have no problem with it, so I thought I would include these as well: this recipe makes for an amazing looking <a href="https://lowcarb-vegan.net/real-bread-low-carb-vegan-style/">bread loaf</a> (and is very similar to a recipe that I myself make and that I love!), you can make a <a href="https://lowcarb-vegan.net/delicious-low-carb-vegan-nutty-bread/">nutty bread</a> and you can even make her <a href="https://lowcarb-vegan.net/low-carb-vegan-focaccia/">low-carb foccacia</a>! Hats off to Martine for these, they look absolutely delicious!

A simple, 5 ingredient recipe to make broccoli parathas stuffed with cream cheese. They are amazing with some pickle for breakfast! And if you are vegan, you can use some almond cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese. 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 bunch of broccoli (250 g)</li>
  <li>3,5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (28 g)</li>
  <li>A big pinch of salt</li>
  <li>8 tbsp (120g) cream cheese (you can substitute for paneer if you want)</li>
  <li>4 tsp ghee</li>
  <li>Spices to taste (optional)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Cook the broccoli (boil or steam) until fork tender, without overcooking so it doesnt lose the green color.
  2. Blend the broccoli with 2 tbsp water. 
  3. Add the <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> and salt to the broccoli puree, along with other spices if you want (some garlic powder and onion powder could be great!) and mix until you have a dough. 
  4. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. 
  5. Using a chakla or a rolling pin (i like to cover my surface with plastic wrap to avoid any stickiness - by putting a bit of water on the surface first, the plastic wrap won't move when you roll), roll each part into a very thin disk of about 1 mm thickness. 
  6. Take a disk, spread 2 tbsp cheese on it, then put another disk on top. Pinch the edges to seal. 
  7. Melt 1 tsp of ghee on a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook the paratha for 3-4 minutes on one side until it is brown, then filp and cook further 2-3 minutes. 
  8. Cook all four parathas this way and serve with a low carb pickle.

Raw cabbage is delicious for salads. And when combined with sauteed tofu and a tahini dressing, it makes an amazing meal. Even my mom, who is a bit skeptical about cabbage, kept saying it was amazing!


<ul>
  <li>1 cup shredded cabbage (70 g)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup shredded purple cabbage (35 g)</li>
  <li>125 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt (or more to taste)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black salt (kala namak) (sub for regular salt if not available)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/4 garlic clove (or less, to taste)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tahini</li>
  <li>Stevia or other sweetener to taste</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp water</li>
  <li>Spicy Paprika, Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the cubed tofu with the black salt and some black pepper, and fry for 10-15 minutes until it is golden and slightly crunchy.
  2. Meanwhile, chop the cabbabe.
  3. Mix all the other ingredients except the paprika to make the dressing. If you aren’t a big garlic fan, leave it in a big chunk and let it infuse, then take out before eating.
  4. Add half of the dressing to the cabbage and mix well to cover it.
  5. Once the tofu is done, serve on top of the cabbage, add the rest of the dressing and some paprika, and serve while it is still warm.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src= "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2718/32865236166_44a912cebe_o_d.jpg" />

Most low-carb breads use eggs, and the only vegan ones I have come across all contain vital wheat gluten. I don't mind consuming gluten every now and then, but I like having some paleo vegan options available as well. 

This recipe is a godsend. The texture of these breadbuns are amazing! The only issue with these in my opinion is that the agar gives a bit of an aftertaste, but you can substitute the agar eggs for flax eggs instead, which would also decrease the carbcount significantly.

Little tip: if the bread seem to be puffing up a lot in the oven, but they deflate and end up being empty inside when they cool down, try reducing the baking powder a little bit.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup of almond flour (110 g)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (30 g)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp agar flakes OR <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a> ground + 6 tbsp boiling water (can be substituted for 3 egg whites if not vegan)</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 and 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1,5 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>2 cups of boiling water</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 200C. 
  2. Mix the agar with the 6 tbsp water. If it doesn't dissolve, put in the microwave for a minute until it is well dissolved and very thick.
  3. Mix all the dry ingredients. Put them in a food processor and add the agar. Mix until you have a crumbly dough. 
  4. Add 1,5 cups of water and mix. Add the rest of the water as needed to get a sticky and firm dough. 
  5. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form little balls with them. 
  6. Put in a baking tray and bake for 40 minutes or until when you tap the bottom, they sound hollow.

This was one of my favorite winter soups before going low carb. I used to only use butternut squash, but since it is quite high in carbs, I decided to mix it with cauliflower to lower the carb count, and the final result is fantastic! Hope you give it a go!

<ul>
  <li>200 g (1,5 cups) butternut squash, chopped</li>
  <li>200 g (2 cups) cauliflower, chopped</li>
  <li>35 g onion</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
  <li>2 cups of broth of choice</li>
  <li>1/3 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil. Add the onion and ginger and fry for 2 minutes. 
  2. Add the rest of ingredients. Boil in an open pot for about 20 minutes, or in a pressure cooker for 8 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. 
  3. Use a hand blender to smoothen it. Add more liquid if you like it thinner. 
  4. Serve inmediately.

Soy is almost unavoidable in a vegetarian diet, especially for lowcarbers. But a lot of people are alergic, others are intolerant, and other people like me don't want to base all their nourishment on a single ingredient...

But here comes Chickpea Tofu to the rescue!

The original recipe is from Birmania: a tofu made from chickpea flour that is served as is in salads. I modified it a bit, reducing the amount of chickpea flour and incorporating some flax and protein powder to make it lower carb and higher protein. 

The result are tofu cubes with a very delicate flavor and texture, that can be sauteed in oil, which makes them slightly crunchy on the outside but still pillowy in the inside. A real delicacy!

My favorite way of having them is sauteed with coconut oil and spices, served warm over salad with some fresh coriander. Yum.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) chickpea flour</li>
  <li>50g flavor free protein powder (like <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">unflavored whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (50g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>1/2-2/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/4-1/3 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients. Then add one cup of the water and mix until you have a batter/paste. 
  2. Take the rest of the water to a boil. When it starts boiling, gently add in the batter while whisking. 
  3. Keep simmering while whisking for about 8 minutes, until it is as thick as clay. You can whisk in the beginning, then switch to a spatula when it gets thicker. 
  4. Pour in a lightly greased mold and let it cool down in the fridge for at least one hour.

I don't know why bhindi (okra) is not as popular as other low-carb vegetables. It has only 4.3 g net carbs for 100 grams and it  truly is delicious! The only thing you have to remember is to cook it properly to get rid of the slimy texture inside, so beware of that! 

<ul>
  <li>2,5 cups of bhindi/okra (250 g)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil: I use 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> and 1 tbsp mustard oil</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium onion)</li>
  <li>100 g fresh tomato (1/2 medium)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 dried red chili, or one green chili (if using fresh: chop and add with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>Dried spices: 1/3 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp dried fenugreek leaves</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the coconut oil and use it to fry the chopped bhindi. This should take at least 15 minutes, until the slime disappears. It is a very important step, as otherwise you will end up with a slimy, gross curry!
  2. Take out the bhindi and keep for later. Add the rest of the oil (I used mustard oil) and add the cumin and dried red chilli. 
  3. When the cumin starts to pop, cook for about 30 seconds, then add the onion, garlic and ginger, with a bit of salt. Cook for 5-10 minutes until it is soft. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and spices (except the fenugreek leaves). Cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are broken down.
  5. Now put the bhindi back in the pan, add salt and 1/2 cup of water and cook covered on low heat for about 5-10 minutes. If there is too much liquid, cook it without the lid.
  6. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves and coriander, as well as some lemon juice (optional) and serve.

It is no news that i love indian food. One of my favorite things about it is roti and naan - so of course i suffer their loss when i do keto. I have struggled to find good egg-free recipes for keto bread; my recipe for [coconut roti](http://maria.recipes/coconutRoti) is delicious but coconut flour is quite expensive. So - here comes flax roti to the rescue! These are only 1 g net carb per roti (!!!), they are super soft, they actually puff up a little bit when cooking them like real roti do, and they can be stuffed to make parathas (recipe coming soon). Also, you can make a big batch and freeze them individually. Awesome :D 

<ul>
  <li>1 cup (150g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>2.5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>(20 g)</li>
  <li>1/2-3/4 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
  <li>Spices to taste; I like 1/4 tsp garlic and 1/4 tsp onion</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>About 2 tsp olive oil to cook</li>
  <li>Optional: about 3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> for rolling</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients.
  2. Add boiling water (start with 3/4 cup of water and add more depending on how much is needed). Knead it a little with your hands to make sure it is even. You should have a very sticky but quite firm dough.
  3. Divide the dough into five. Make a disk with each piece; if they dry up, wet them so it is easier to make the disk.
  4. For forming them, you can either use coconut flour and form as you would a normal roti (i used a chakla) or you can put it between plastic wrap and use a rolling pin or press them down into a thin disk of about 2 mm thick.
  5. Cook over medium-high heat on a lightly greased pan or tawa for about 2 minutes per side.

A very simple side dish suitable for all types of diet. It is a traditional style of cooking in spain, often made with cabbage with pieces of potatoes, or with cauliflower.


<ul>
  <li>1/4 big head of cabbage, shredded, or 320 g cabbage</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 to 1/3 tsp paprika (I like spicy paprika)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring 1.5 liters of water to the boil. Add the shredded cabbage and cok for 3-5 minutes depending on how cooked you like your vegetables. 
  2. While it boils, fry the garlic with the coconut oil.
  3. Once the cabbage is boiled, drain it, then add it to the golden garlic. Add the salt and some black pepper and cook for about 3 minutes. 
  4. Turn off the stove, add the olive oil and paprika, taste for seasoning, and serve.

This pizza base is seriously awesome. I used [this recipe](http://www.meatfreeketo.com/vegan-fathead-pizza-crust/) but omitted the vegan cheese and used some nutritional yeast instead to get some cheesy flavor. Seriously: this pizza holds its shape perfectly, is chewy and salty and delicious, vegan, and only 3.1 g net carbs for half a pizza crust!


<ul>
  <li>85 g of <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground (1/2 cup + 1.5 tbsp)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>(32 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp (6 g) nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water</li>
  <li>For Margharita Pizzaa: 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 cup (110 g) shredded mozzarella (you can use vegan mozzarella, but it will change the macros), 1/2 cup tomato passata, some dried oregano, fresh basil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  2. In a bowl, mix everything except the water. Then add the water little by little until you form a dough.
  3. Put the dough on a parchment paper, put another paper on top and then spread it out with a rolling pin until it is 2-3 mm thick. Once it is even, cut it out to whichever shape you want (I used a big lid to make it round). If it cracks, use your finger with a little bit of water to smooth it out. 
  4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until it's slightly dry and golden.
  5. Put whichever toppings you want and then bake for another 5-10 minutes.

Parsley, garlic and olive oil are a classic combination in spanish cuisine, and they are often combined in a green sauce that is used for vegetables or fish. 

This is an easy side dish for a weeknight dinner or for serving up to your guests. 

<ul>
  <li>200 g white button mushrooms, only caps</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 small clove of garlic</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste (optional)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley: a handful (about 1/4 cup)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Blend the olive oil, garlic, spices, lemon juice, vinegar and parsley (traditionally, a morter and pestle should be used).
  2. Put the mushrooms over medium-low on a lightly greased pan. Cover with a lid and cook for about 10 minutes turning them halfway through, until they are soft. 
  3. Take them out, sprinkle with a bit of salt and fill them with a bit of the green sauce.

I love sautéed tofu; it gets very chewy and crunchy, and when mixed with spices it can be delicious.

<ul>
  <li>2 cups (250 g) firm tofu, cubed OR 200 g paneer (if using paneer, omit mayonnaise)</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>4 cups of fresh spinach (120g) OR 4 cups shredded lettuce (180g)</li> 
  <li>1 cup of fresh cucumber (130g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup of fresh red bell pepper (75g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise OR 3/4 extra tbsp coconut oil and 3/4 extra tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>Optional: Chaat masala, to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non-stick pan, melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Then add the tofu and all the spices along with 1/2 tbsp lemon juice. Sautée for 15-20 minutes until it is very golden and firm.
  2. Mix all the other ingredients and serve while the tofu is still warm. If you are making this ahead of time, keep the tofu in a separate container and warm up before eating.

This soup takes about 20 minutes to put together, is loaded with protein and healthy fats, and amazingly tasty! 

If you are in a hurry you can cut the cooking time of the tofu and the onions by half, but I really love how the tofu gets a little bit crunchy on the outside. 

<ul>
  <li>250 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>One small red onion (70g), coarsly chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste or 1/2 inch ginger chopped</li>
  <li>1 medium zucchini (200g) spiralized or two broccoli stalks (about 140g) spiralized (omit for fewer carbs)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste or one big garlic clove chopped</li>
  <li>100 g mushrooms, sliced</li>
  <li>2/3 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
  <li>One bouillon cube</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick pot, put half the oil and add the onion, garlic and ginger. Cook ovver medium-low heat with a pinch of salt for about 15-20 minutes. 
  2. At the same time, in a non stick pan, add the other half of the oil, then cook the cubed tofu over high heat until it is very brown and dry, about 15 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, cook for about 5 minutes. Lastly, add the spiralized zucchini and cook for a minute.
  3. Once the onion is very soft, add the curry powder, coconut milk, water, chili and bouillon cube. Bring to a boil, then use blend with a hand mixer. 
  4. Add the tofu, mushrooms and zoodles. Let it all boil together for 1-2 minutes.
  5. Serve with coriander.

If you miss eating fajitas, or having curry with chapati... this recipe is for you! You will get really soft tortillas/chapati, with a light coconut flavour, that pairs well both with meats and veggies :) 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a></li>
  <li>2 tbsp (16 g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a></li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt (omit if using stock)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water or stock</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60g) butter or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>Optional: spices to taste (I like to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder)</li>
  <li>5 tsp oil, for cooking</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the butter or coconut oil. Mix separately the <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>, spices and salt, then incorporate the butter.
  2. Add the water or stock, hot (almost boiling). Incorporate and mix until you have a sticky dough.  
  3. Now you have to act fast or else the dough will dry out: divide it into four balls. Knead each one a bit, then put in between two pieces of plastic wrap, and form a disk using a rolling pin or flattening it with a tray; it should be 2-3 mm thick. Then take something round (like the lid of a pan) and use it to cut the roti.
  4. Proceed this way for four tortillas. For the fifth one, use the remaining pieces you cut out of the others. If you prefer, you can just divide the dough in five and make 5 roti from the beginning, without cutting them out (although they won't be as round).
  5. Put a teaspoon of oil in a pan over high heat. Fry the roti about 2 minutes per side until golden.
  6. Keep in a cloth so they remain soft until you eat them, or let them cool down and freeze individually, separated by some parchment paper.

This recipe for burger patties using mung beans is a great way to get some legumes in your diet. Mung beans (green soy) have a very nice flavor, and if you let them sprout, the carb count will be lower and they will have more protein. On top of that, you can add any spices you want to get different styles.  

It is hard to know the exact nutritional information for this recipe as it depends on how long the beans sprout for; I estimated the data sprouting them for 3 or 4 days.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (100g) mung beans (green soy)</li>
  <li>Optional: 30 g unflavored protein powder (such as <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> or butter or ghee</li>
  <li>Other spices to taste</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Let the beans sprout for 3 or 4 days until they have roots of 1-2 cm. 
  2. Blend all the ingredients until you have a thick paste. 
  3. Divide into four and form patties using your hands.  
  4. Fry each patty with 1/2 tbsp oil until it is golden on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).

A great recipe for all those vegan ketoers, or anyone who cannot eat eggs but still wants to eat some french amazingness. You can adapt this basic recipe to your taste, changing the vegetables and/or adding other ingredients, such as cheese or meat! 


<ul>
  <li> 1 <a href="http://maria.recipes/ketoCrust">low-carb crust</a> </li>
  <li> 1.5 cups of chopped zucchini (180-200 g, one medium) </li>
  <li> One leek (80g) </li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li> 400 g firm tofu</li>
  <li> 3-4 tbsp water</li>
  <li> 1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li> Black pepper to taste</li>
  <li> <i>Optional: 3 tbsp nutritional yeast</i> </li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
  2. Use the oil to fry your vegetables. 
    - _I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to my vegetables to get some umami, as I didn't have nutritional yeast!_
  3. Blend the tofu with the water, turmeric, salt and pepper. You should get a dense batter.
  4. Add the cooked vegetables to the tofu mixture, then spoon over your crust.
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is set. Let it cool for 5 minutes before cutting into it.

This crust, based on the recipe from [healthfulpursuit](http://www.healthfulpursuit.com), takes a while to make, but is gluten-free, egg-free, vegan, low carb, and has a great flavor! 


<ul>
  <li>1 + 1/4 cups ground <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a></li>
  <li>1/4 sunflower seeds, ground</li>
  <li>80-100 g onion (one small)</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>Other ingredients to taste, for example one clove of garlic (minced)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oven to 110C.
  2. Blend the onion with the oil and vinegar. 
  3. In a separate bowl mix the other ingredients, then add the onion mixture. You should get a thick paste, dry but not crumbly. If it crumbles, add some water.
  4. Grease your quiche mold very well (or even better, put a circle of parchment paper in the bottom) and put the mixture inside. Then use a spoon or your hands to form the crust. Water your hands to smooth it out.
  5. Bake for 90 minutes until it is dry and crunchy. Then, take it out and add the filling of choice,

It had been so long since I published any indian food! This is one of my favorite veg curries. It is sweet with a slightly acid touch thanks to the mango powder (that can be substituted for lemon), and is awesome with some dal and rice or roti.


<ul>
  <li>500 g pumpkin or butternut squash</li>
  <li>Dried red chili (1-2)</li>
  <li>100 g onion</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida (can be subbed for 1/2 tsp garlic paste, that would be used with the ginger)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, to serve</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil (mustard or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or 1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Stevia or sweetener to taste (equivalent to 1 tsp sugar)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil. Fry the fenugreek seeds, chili and asafoetida for 2 minutes (don't burn them!!!).
  2. Add the ginger. Cook for 1 minute, then add the onion and salt. Cook on slow heat for about 10 minutes, until it is brown and soft. 
  3. Add the pumpkin and spices (except amchoor) and some more salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Then, pour 1/4 cup water and cover.
  4. Cook on low heat. Once the pumpkin is soft, add the rest of the ingredients, mix and serve.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/403/31699704665_590bb3e042_o_d.jpg" />

This is an indian appetizer from the region of Gujarat: vegan savory pancakes made with moong lentils, and filled with anything you like. They can be had plain with chutney, or filled with paneer (like I did), tomato onion and coriander, or whatever you fancy. 
They are usually had with tea in the afternoon, but I like them as a lunch or dinner appetizer: they are light, full of protein and everybody likes them, even the biggest of carnivores!


<ul>
  <li>1/2 moong dal, preferibly peeled (100 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp asafoetida (you can substitute it with 1/2 clove of garlic, smashed into a paste)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt </li>
  <li>Chilli to taste (preferibly green chili paste)</li>
  <li>A few drops of stevia (equivalent to 2 tsp sugar)</li>
  <li>50 g paneer (or cottage cheese)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp Chaat masala (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp fresh coriander</li>
  <li>2 tsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> (for cooking)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash the lentils properly, then soak them for 3-4 hours. 
  2. Drain, add 3 tbsp water and grind into a fine paste. If necessary you can add more water. You should end up with a pancake-like batter. 
  3. Add the salt, baking soda, asafoetida and stevia and mix well. 
  4. Lightly grease a pan or tawa (with 1/2 tsp oil per chilla it is usually enough) and put it over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 of the batter and use a spatula to make a thin disk of about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Put the filling on top while it cooks; in this case, paneer, coriander and a bit of chaat masala. 
  6. When the batter starts to dry in the top (about 2-3 minutes), flip it, cook another minute, flip again and fold it in half to keep the filling inside. Proceed with the other chilla. 
  7. Serve them with more paneer, coriander, chaat masala, tomato and onion, or with your favorite chutney.

This is one of these recipes that I make in bulk and then freeze for an easy lunch or dinner for another day. These sausages are fenomenal, very high protein and quite low-carb, so they make for a great dinner when combined with some cauli-rice, keto bbq sauce and salad. Hope you enjoy them!


<ul>
  <li>250 g <a href="http://amzn.to/2n4ufue">vital wheat gluten</a></li>

  <li>2 tbsp onion powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tsp sweet paprika</li>

  5. Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece in a sausage shape with some aluminum foil. 
  6. Steam for 30 minutes. 
  7. Let them cool down and keep in the fridge or freezer. When you want to eat them, just stir-fry them with some oil and enjoy!

This is my go-to keto breakfast with some coconut milk or greek yogurt, and it is also great when I am travelling (I just ask for some whole-fat yogurt and add my granola right there!). It is more of a guideline to make your own keto-fied granola, a low carb and extra crunchy cereal that you can customize to your own taste.

A very handy recipe for any low-carb vegetarians or vegans out there: 10 g protein and only 5.5 g of net carbs per pattie. And they can be frozen raw, to thaw and use for a quick simple meal!
(Warning: do not sprout the soy beans for this recipe. They develop a very weird taste!). 
You can change the spices according to your taste, to make different flavored burgers.

<ul>
    <li>150 g soy beans</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil (you can use less if you prefer)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 flax "eggs": 3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground + 6 tbsp warm water</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tsp liquid smoke</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Soak the beans for 12 hours.
  2. Boil the beans for about 45 minutes, or until they are softer but still have texture (if they get too mushy, the burgers won't hold)
  3. Prepare the flax eggs and let them rest 5 minutes.
  4. Process the beans until you get a couscous texture. Then, mix with the rest of ingredients to form a dense mixture. 
  5. Divide into 6 and form the patties with your hands.
  6. Cook with a teaspoon of olive oil over medium-high heat, about 2-3 minutes per side.

It is so difficult to make vegan keto pancakes!! Coconut flour gets really funky when not mixed with eggs... I always ended up having a blobby slimy mess! 

I decided to adapt my previos keto pancake recipe, increasing the oil to get a more consistent batter that wouldn't end up making crepes rather than pancakes, and using a flax egg (remember to let it rest 5 minutes before using it!). I like to use vanilla protein powder: depending on the brand, you might have to adjust the liquid (add a bit less to the flax egg), and if you use unflavored protein, you might want to add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and stevia to taste.

These are not super fluffy, but they require very few ingredients, they are easy to make and they make an awesome breakfast when topped with a piece of my [keto chocolate](http://maria.recipes/ketoChocolate)!

<ul>
  <li>1 flax egg: 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground + 3 tbsp water</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>1/2 scoop of vanilla flavor vegan Powder (<a href="http://amzn.to/2nRfHwC">whey</a> or a vegan powder) (2 tbsp)</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the flax, protein powder, salt and baking powder. 
  2. In a separate bowl, mix the flax egg with the oil.
  3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix well. You should end up with a dense mixture.
  4. Heat up a lightly greased non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot, divide the pancake mixture into three and pour. You will need a slightly wet spoon to smooth out the pancakes so they are about 1/2 cm thick.
  5. Cook 5 minutes on the first side until, then flip over and cook 2 more minutes.

I am so happy about this lasagna! It is vegetarian (and can be vegan if you use a vegan milk and omit the mozzarella) and low-carb, and it is as good as the traditional one!

For the sauce, you can combine milk and heavy cream as you want, and/or use vegetarian milks to lower the carb count. In my case, i used soy milk mixed with single cream.


<ul>
    <li>2 medium zucchini (400 g)</li>
    <li>2/3 chopped onion (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>50 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a> ground</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a></li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li> 
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini in thin strips of about 2 mm thick. Then cook with a little bit of olive oil on a non-stick pan, in the microwave or steam them, until they are slightly softer but not completely mushy!  
  2. Hydrate the soy in salty water or in stock.
  3. Fry the onion on medium heat about 10 minutes until it is soft. After, add the rest of ingredients and 1/2 cup of water and let everything boil until you have a nice thick sauce.
  4. For the white sauce: warm up the water and cream with the nutmeg and some salt. Then add the psyllium and mix very well (you might need a hand mixer). Adjust the texture bu adding more psyllium or more milk. 
  5. Make the lasagna alternating layers of zucchini and soy mixture, and use the bechamel to cover everything. Then add the mozzarella on top.  
  6. Bake at 180-200C for 30 minutes, putting it under the broiler in the last 5 min.

This is not really a new recipe; I just adapted my [previous cabbage roll recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRollso) to decrease the carbs, filling them with soy granules and seeds. They are as good as the original recipe, and this time I made a video on how to make the wraps. I hope you like them. 



<ul>
    <li>One whole cabbage head (we will use the 8 outer leaves, about 260 g)</li>
    <li>70 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds (65g), chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1/2 onion (80g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Spices: 1 tsp spicy paprika,</li> 
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li> 
    <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li> 
    <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li> 
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups of tomato purée (passata)</li> 
    <li>6 cloves</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>A pinch of salt</li> 
    <li>Some sugar or stevia (optional)</li> 
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. First, boil the whole cabbage. I made it in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes. Then, cool with water to stop any further cooking. 
  2. Hydrate the soy granules. Meanwhile, gently fry the onion with 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and bay leaf.
    * If you want the onion to be extra soft and sweet, you can make it like I did  [in my other recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRolls)
  3. Once the onion is soft, add the spices and cook for a minute. Then, add the soy, seeds and tomato paste. Cook for 5 more minutes and then let it cool. You can add fresh parsley or coriander if you like it.
  4. Take the 8 outer cabbage leaves. Put them flat over a surface and, with a knife, trim the stem without cutting all the way through.
  5. Divide the soy mixture into eight, and put a portion onto each cabbage leaf. Then, wrap like I show in the video. 
  6. Put the rolls in a big pot in one or two layers, leaving little space between them. Mix the ingredients for the sauce (all the other ingredients) and pour over the rolls. 
  7. Let them boil for about 30 minutes.
  8. Serve with flax bread, rice, salad...

These are the cutest little fat bombs I have made! They have an almond-butter crust and a creamy lemon filling, full of coconut oil goodness! They are also gluten-free and can be adapted for a dairy-free version, as well!

If you want to have a third layer, add a tablespoon of lemon or strawberry gellatin on top. That would be even lovelier!


<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup almond meal (I used crushed roasted almonds)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>A pinch of stevia or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nR8cWo">erythritol</a> (to taste; I used about 1/2 tsp of truvia)</li>
    <li>25 g melted butter or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>, melted</li>
    <li>The zest of one lemon</li>
    <li>60 g cream cheese (substitute for coconut cream for dairy-free)</li>
    <li>1-2 tbsp lemon juice (to taste)</li>
    <li>Stevia or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nR8cWo">erythritol</a>, to taste (I used 1 tbsp truvia)</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients for the crust: almonds, flax, salt, pinch of stevia. Then add the butter and mix until you have a dough that doesn't crumble. If necessary, add some more butter.
  2. Blend all the ingredients for the cream: coconut oil, zest, cream cheese, lemon juice, sweetener and vanilla extract.
  3. Using small molds (I used ice cream cubes), put a layer of the base and then a layer of the cream on top. I made 16 small fat bombs. 
  5. Let it harden in the fridge (1-2 hours), then take out of the mold. Keep in the fridge until consumed. They will last 4-5 days in the fridge in an air-tight container.

This is super tasty for taco night, but will work for any recipe in which you want to substitute minced meat - just adapt the spices to the recipe you are using! 

If you are using it for mexican food - I would recommend adding some minced vegan chorizo for a more intense flavor. A recipe will be coming up soon!


<ul>
  <li> 50 g small soy granules</li>
  <li> 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
  <li> 1 cup vegetable stock</li>
  <li> 1/2 small red onion (30 g)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> Optional: fresh coriander, to garnish</li>
</ul>



* **Process**
  1. Chop the pumpkin seeds roughly. Put the soy and the seeds in a bowl with the soy sauce and the stock for at least 10-15 minutes to hidrate.
  2. Heat up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Fry on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes until it looks soft.
  3. Add the spices and the tomato purée. Mix and cook for about 1 minute.
  4. Add the soy-seed mixture with its liquid and cook for a few minutes until it warms up. You can add more liquid if you want, or dry it out more to your liking.
  5. Turn off the stove, add the lemon juice and coriander and eat!

An easy way to make your own protein bars, low on carbs, vegan, and only four ingredients. 

This is my version, where I am using sunbutter, but according to the [original recipe](http://meatfreeketo.com/homemade-keto-protein-bar-formula/), any type of nut or seed butter will work, and you can change the proportions to your liking.

<ul>
    <li>6 tbsp cream cheese</li>
    <li>6 tbsp sunbutter, or nut/seed butter of choice</li>
    <li>80 g protein powder (I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2osnH91">chocolate flavored whey</a>)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix everything except the oil with patience. If it is dry, add the oil a bit at a time; i needed 2 tbsp. You should end up with a firm dough, similar to play-doh.
  2. Let it cool down in the fridge.
  3. Cut in 6 equal pieces.

This sauce is THE BOMB. Low-carb. Keto. Vegan. Delicious. 

I just had it with shredded seitan over some salad. Yum! <3

<ul>
    <li>1/3 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 can of tomato sauce (425 g)</li>
    <li>3 tsp liquid smoke</li>
    <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp smoked spicy paprika</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    <li>Sweetener of choice - I used stevia to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a saucepan, warm up the oil and then fry the garlic and onion over low heat for about 10 minutes, until they are very soft.
  2. Take it off the heat and once it cools down a bit (otherwise it will make a mess), add all the ingredients. 
  3. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. 
  4. Once it is done simmering, check for salt and add sweetener to taste. 
  5. _Optional: blend the sauce for a smooth texture_

Super easy and incredibly delicious recipe. Can be vegan and gluten-free, and is full of fiber, flavor, healthy fats – and great for keto-ers! Just add some more fat to fit your macros, and use whatever vegetables you prefer. And if you wish to avoid tofu, you can use paneer (although this will increase the fat content of the recipe).

I like to at it with a big green salad and some keto bread. Makes for an awesome meal to pack for work!


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>600 g tofu OR 450 g paneer</li>
    <li>1/3 of a purple onion, thinly sliced (35 g)</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>100 g spinach, cooked (I use frozen spinach that I then cook in the microwave!)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of coconut milk (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp powdered cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp red chili powder (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 basil leaves optional</li>
    <li>Sugar to taste (I used stevia)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (or 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp fish sauce)</li>
    <li>Half a bunch of broccoli (250 g) (previously steamed, or use it raw and let it cook longer)</li>
    <li>Optional: 60 g of carrot (omit if keto)</li>
    <li>Optional: some fresh coriander</li>
    <li>To garnish: 40 g roasted or fried almonds or peanuts, chopped</li>
    <li>To garnish: lemon or lime</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Start by frying the onion, ginger and carrots over medium heat
  2. In a blender, blend the ingredients for the sauce: spinach, coconut milk, cumin, coriander, chili, black pepper, basil, stevia, soy sauce. Set aside for later. 
  3. Once the onions are very soft, add the tofu and cook over medium-high until it gets golden.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until they are tender (I used steamed broccoli so I only cooked it for 2 minutes so it would warm up). 
  5. Add the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. 
  6. Turn of the heat, sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve with some lemon or lime.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/316/31326178640_1525979703_o_d.jpg" />

This is one of my hostess' specialty, vegetable pulao, for 4-5 people. An easy one-dish meal that can be slightly changed and always comes out equally delicious. You can use chatever vegetables you ike, such as green peas, broccoli cauliflower, potatoes, red capsisum...


<ul>
  <li>Vegetables, chopped: 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1/2 green capsicum pepper, handful of green beans, green chili to taste.</li>
  <li>_Optional, to add more protein: textured soy protein, soaked_</li>
  <li>Whole masala: 4 bay leaves, 4 green cardamoms crushed, 2 black cardamom, 4-5 cm stick of cinnamon, 10 cloves, 12 black peppercorns + 10 small whole garlic cloves</li>
  <li>Rice: about a cup (roughly the same volume as the vegetables), rinsed</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>Red chili to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek leaves (optional)</li>
  <li>Sugar to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1-2 tsp salt, in total</li>
  <li>Optional: yoghurt or curd (especially good for leftovers!)</li>
  <li> To garnish: coriander (about 1/2 cup), lemon juice, mint (usually saved for meat pulaos)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan with 3-4 tbsp oil (or less, if you are fat-conscious), add the whole masala and brown them on low heat.
  2. Add the onions and cook them for 15-20 minutes, until they are super brown and caramelised and delicious.
  3. Add the carrots and cook them for a couple of minutes to avoid them being raw in the end. Then, add all the other veggies. Cook and cover until slightly soft, on low heat.
  4. Add the soy meat, salt and spices and mix thoroughly. After a couple of minutes, add the rice, mix, add the turmeric, and mix again.
  5. Now, you can either add some water and fresh coriander and cook it without a lid, or pressure cook it for 2 whistles on high flame.
  6. Once the rice is cooked through, fluff up with a fork, garnish with some more coriander, and enjoy.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/609/31552398312_4d6638dcdd_o_d.jpg" />


While in India I visited Bangalore. In indian restaurants in Europe the food that is mostly served is North Indian. However, south indian cuisine has so much variety and uses such different flavours when compared to North Indian! 

In this case, I was taught how to make Bisi Bele Bath, a wonderful south indian dish for the rainy season. It is usually a one-pot meal, the perfect comfort food to have in a cozy evening, enough to serve 6 people. 

The friend that taught this to me tweaks the recipe a little bit, mixing different dals and using two pots instead of one. However, if you want to go for the most traditional version, use only toor dal and rice (it can be cooked in the same pot and at the same time as the rice), and skip the tadka; this will make for an easier one-pot meal.


<ul>
  <li>2 cup of mixed dal</li>
  <li>3 fistfuls of rice and 2 of broken wheat (you can use all rice for the traditional version, about 1.5 cups)</li>
  <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
  <li>_Optional: 2 tomatoes, chopped_</li>
  <li>4-5 small shallots, peeled and whole, or a few pieces of green capsicum</li>
  <li>_Optional: a few green beans, chopped_</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li>1/2-1 tbsp tamarind paste (if you dont have any, you can use lemon juice instead)</li>
  <li>5-6 tbsp of bisibelebath masala mixture OR: 1.5 tbsp coriander powder, 1 tbsp black gram dal powder, 2-3 tsp chili powder, 1-1.5 tsp cumin powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp fenugreek powder, 3-4 cloves and a few curry leaves</li>
  <li>For the tadka (optional): pinch of asafoetida, dried red chilies to taste, a bunch of curry leaves, 1 tsp black mustard seeds, 1-2 tbsp roasted bengal gram (optional) or cashews, vegetable oil</li>
  <li>_Optional: jaggery or sugar to taste, cashew nuts (if not used in tadka)_</li>
  <li>_Optional: fresh coriander to garnish_</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash and rinse the dal a couple of times. Tren, soak for at least 4 hours. 
  2. In a fast cooker,pour the dal with its soaking water, then add some salt, asafoetida, turmeric, shallots and carrots. Close the lid and let it whistle about 3 times or until it smells like the dal is cooked. 
  3. Meanwhile, rinse the rice and broken wheat properly. Then, put it in a pot with salted water and boil until cooked.
  4. Now, mix the cooked dal and rice in the pot where you cooked the rice in and add the tomatoes. 
  5. Once the tomatoes are soft, add the bisibelebath masala. Mix well and cook together for a couple of minutes. Add water if it is too thick. 
  6. Add the tamarind into the mixture. Then, taste for salt and sweetness. 
  7. Finally (optionally), make the tadka. Heat up 2-3 tbsp of oil in a small pan and fry the whole spices until brown in this order: asafoetida, mustard seeds, chillies, bengal gram and curry leaves. Once it is done, add it into the pot and put a lid on it for the aromas to infuse. 
  8. Mix everything and serve.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/551/31326382390_388b0acfaa_o_d.jpg" />

There are many vegetarian people in India, so traditional spanish cuisine (very often pork-based) is not very appropriate here, and on top of that, anything european is considered bland (because no chili, no taste, apparently!). So finding something to cook that they would like (that wasnt indian food!) seemed difficult.

So... chili to the rescue! I make my chili meatless and with loooooads of veggies (way more than the usual chili con carne have), and I like to add some cacao for a deeper, earthier flavor. I had to omit some spices, but I will transcribe the recipe I usually make so you can enjoy it to the fullest! 

For those who watch the videos: im so sorry about the terrible picture quality. But cooking in a new kitchen with limited resources and at 40 degrees temperature, being a good photographer was the least of my worries :)


<ul>
  <li>400 g cooked kidney beans (rajma), about 3 cups</li>
  <li>2 cloves of garlic, very finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
  <li>3 red bell peppers, finely chopped (you can sub one for a different color pepper)</li>
  <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
  <li>300-400 g tomato puree</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>Spices (adjust to your taste): 1/2-1 tsp cumin, _1/2 tsp oregano optional_, 1/4 tsp black pepper, _1/4 tsp cinnamon powder optional_, 1 tbsp cacao powder, 1-2 tbsp sugar, _10 g of dark cooking chocolate optional_, 1 tsp of chipotle paste _(you can substitute it for 1 tsp of red chili powder and, if you want, cook the peppers on an open flame for a couple of minutes to get that smoky flavor one gets from the chipotle.)_</li>
  <li>_Optional: 1/2 cup of corn grains, raw_</li> 
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a large pot or pan with 2-3 tbsp olive oil, add the onions and garlic with 1/4 tsp of salt. Cook on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes until nice and soft. 
  2. Add the peppers and corn with 1/4 tsp of salt and cook, covered, for about 10 minutes until the peppers start to soften. 
  3. Add the spices (except for the chocolate) and cook 1-2 minutes. Then, add the tomato paste, puree and the tomatoes chopped, along with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 cup of water and cook on a low heat, uncovered. 
  4. After 15-20 minutes it should start to be nice and thick. It should cook for at least 20-30 minutes, so add a bit of water if it is becoming too dry. 
  5. When there are only a couple of minutes left for it to finish, add the chocolate and mix it well so it melts. Then, taste and add salt, chili or even chocolate if you need it. 
  6. Serve nice and warm. It can stay in the fridge for 3-4 days, and it even gets better flavor! It is also freezer-friendly, so I usually make a huge batch and freeze some for another week.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/31326152400_e4b9f7eb3a_o_d.jpg" />

My boyfriend (who so lovingly codes everything for my website, and is the one responsible for the gorgeous look it has!) loves sausages for breakfast. It is one of the few things that I don't like him eating, since it is very fatty, processed, unhealthy meat. The only other things he would like for breakfast usually involve a long time of cooking, so I have been trying to come up with a savory breakfast for him that does not include chicken and can be cooked fast in the morning.

So, these sausages came to be: meaty, spicy sausages, that take a little bit of prepping time but that can last in the fridge (or freezer) for a while, making for an easy breakfast, but also awesome in pizzas or sandwiches. You will be gladly surprised when you try it! In fact, I like these better than traditional sausages :)

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup cooked chickpeas or white beans, mashed with a fork</li>
  <li>Spices: 1 tsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp crushed fennel seeds (the recipe I used in the beginning suggested 1 tsp of ground fennel seed instead, but I rather prefer the crushed seed version), 1 tsp spicy paprika, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1 cup of vegetable broth</li>
  <li>1+1/4 cups of vital wheat gluten</li>
  <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Firstly, prepare your water in the steamer.
  2. Mix in a bowl the nutritional yeast and the wheat gluten. In a different bowl, mix all the other ingredients. 
  3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix thoroughly. You will end up with an elastic ball that forms "threads" (those are your proteins!). 
  4. Make the shape you want: either form small sausages or one big loaf. Cover each sausage/loaf with cheese cloth.
   - _If you don't have any cheese cloth, I recommend using sterile gauze pads (If you have a doctor in the family, you will probably have some around the house!)_
  5. Place on your steamer and steam about 35 minutes if making small sausages, or about 50 min if making one big loaf. The cooking time depends a lot on the size of your sausages, so it can vary a lot. If in doubt, just cut it in half and check that the center has changed its texture, losing that "thready" property it had when raw.
  6. Eat immediately or save for later.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/608/31698792525_4c207670e9_o_d.jpg" />

Chowmein is an indo-chinese dish, very typical from Nepal: streetfood served often in doubtious places, but delicious!  

Normally this would use whole-wheat noodles, but I decided to substitute them for spiralized vegetables. I am using turnips, but you could use other white vegetables. It also usually has carrot but I am avoiding it to keep it low-carb. 

The most popular ones are Veg Chowmein (vegetarian) and Chicken Chowmein (chicken), although other types of meat can be used, or shrimp or egg. I sometimes make it using tofu (to have some protein but keep it vegan), but whoever wants to can add the meat or shrimp along with the vegetables so they fry together. And of course, quantities are just to orientate you, and can be adapted!

This is a strong and tasty dish, spicy and slightly sweet, perfect for 3-4 people. I hope you like it.

<ul>
  <li>3 spiralized turnips, 360g (or you can substitute for whole-wheat noodles)</li>
  <li>1/4 cabbage (300g), thinly sliced (you can use the spiralizer for this!)</li>
  <li>1/2 red bell pepper (60g), cut in trips</li>
  <li>1 medium red onion (100g)</li>
  <li>Other optional vegetables, such as a handful of boiled green beans</li>
  <li>250 g firm tofu (optional)</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves very finely chopped or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>Strips of fresh ginger (that should be added with the other vegetables) or 2 tsp ginger paste (that would be added with the garlic)</li>
  <li>3 eggs (optional)</li>
  <li>Optional: spring onions, for garnishing</li>
  <li>4 tsp soy sauce (half could be substituted for oyster sauce, for non-vegetarian people)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp red chili paste or red chili powder (this should be adapted to taste; 1 tsp is very spicy)</li>
  <li>Salt. </li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tsp rice vinager, lime juice, or something similar</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut oil</li>
  <li>To serve: ketchup and chili sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a big enough pan, over medium-high heat, put a tablespoon of oil and then fry the cubed tofu until golden, for about 5 minutes. Later, take it out and put aside for later. 
  2. Pour the rest of the oil in the pan and add the onion. Let them cook for 5 minutes. When they start to turn translucent, add the rest of the vegetables and cook until tender.
  3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes so it loses the raw flavor.
  4. Add the vegetable "noodles", mix well and then pour the sauce over everything.
  5. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the "noodles" are tender. Check for salt. 
  6. Serve with some kétchup and chili sauce on top.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/366/30888724203_7b9d744d76_o_d.jpg" />

Falafel are a sort of "meatball" made of chickpeas, typical from the Middle East. they are traditionally vegan and deep-fried. 

I am not a bit fan of frying (not just because of the fat, but because I'm actually a bit scared!) so I've been trying to find a good no-fry falafel recipe. But most of the ones I found used eggs, or ended up adding a whole lot of breadcrumbs into the mixture, or something of the sort...

So I thought I should try with chickpeas + chickpea flour, and the result is very good. The first time they were completely oil-free; they were tasty but a little bit dry, so I would recommend you use it.

You will get crunchy falafel with a moist inside, perfect for any time.


<ul>
  <li>400 g boiled chickpeas</li>
  <li>1 small onion</li>
  <li>1 (or 2) garlic cloves</li>
  <li>A handful of parsley, aprox 1/2 cup (you can substitute half or everything for fresh coriander)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp chickpea flour</li>
  <li>2 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>2 tsp powdered cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of olive oil (you can add a bit more if you want to)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C
  2. Process all of the ingerdients until you have a firm mixture.
  3. With your hands, form your falafel as little balls or disks, and put them in a greased oven tray, without them touching one another.
  4. Bake for about half an hour, or until they are slightly golden and crunchy on the outside.


Serse with tahini dip, with yoghurt and mint sauce, in a pita bread sandwich... Whatever you like best.

Although I am not a big fan of mayo, I do feel like eating it every now and then. But it is full of fat, so I rarely buy any. 

Today I bring you a healthier "mayonnaise", that I like to call "Tofunnaise". This eggless sauce is silky and delicious, doesnt require any special skills to make it (no risk of messing up, like with real mayo!), is VERY low fat and is high in protein. 

It is obviously not exactly like the real deal. But it has a very nice flavor and texture, and I am positive you won't miss the mayo if you have tofunnaise!

<ul>
  <li>100 g of firm tofu</li>
  <li>40 g of plain yoghurt, use vegan yoghurt for vegan tofunnaise</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp of Dijon mustard (I  like to add 1/2 tsp, but it will have a strong taste)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp white vinager</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Process until smooth. Taste for salt.

A very easy to make, healthy and tasty recipe. The different flavours combine perfectly, and I often omit the ham for a vegan version. Steaming the eggplant makes the flavour stand out a lot, which I find lovely, but if you are not an eggplant fan, this is not for you!

<ul>
  <li>2 eggplants</li>
  <li>100 g cubed tofu</li>
  <li>50-100 g cubed or sliced and chopped ham (optional; can be omitted for a vegan version)</li>
  <li>For the sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp white whine (or 1 tbsp vinager and a bit of honey, to taste), optional: 1-2 cloves of garlic finely chopped, optional: 1/2 tsp ginger paste, ground black pepper, salt (depending on how salty the soy sauce is), 1 tbsp corn starch</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, or fresh parsley for those who don't like coriander</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Prepare a pan in which you will steam the eggplant.
  2. Cut the eggplants lenghtwise and make some cuts into the flesh without going all the way through.
  3. Put the eggplants on the recipient where you will steam them later.. 
  4. Put the ham and tofu on top, and then pour the sauce over everything for it to impregnate the eggplant. Garnish with a little bit of coriander or parsley.
   - _Don't spill the sauce; if there is too much, keep it and add it a couple of minutes before it is done cooking._
  5. Steam for about 25 minutes until the eggplants are tender. Add some more coriander or parsley, then serve.

This is a dish that my bae and I love. He is usually not a big fan of vegetables, but when I make this, it disappears in no time! And I love it too not just because of the flavour, but because it takes very little time to make (the most annoying part is chopping the vegetables!).

The final result is very good, and combines wonderfully with some plain basmati rice. For those who want to, sometimes I like to add some pan-fried paneer or tofu to have some more protein in my meal. 

An easy and  yummy curry, it's worth trying!


<ul>
  <li>250 g sliced mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 medium brown onion (110g), finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 medium-sized tomato (140g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp powdered chili (or to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</li>
  <li>Lemon juice: 1 tbsp or to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh coriander to garnish</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, add the onion with a bit of salt and brown them for about 5 minutes. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and let them cook for 1-2 minutes, so they loose their "raw" flavour. 
  3. Turn down the heat and add the powdered spices and let them roast for about a minute to become more fragrant (if the pan is too dry and the spices might burn, add a bit of water). 
  4. Add the mushrooms with a bit of salt, mix, turn the heat to medium and cover. 
  5. Cook stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are almost cooked. 
  6. Add the tomato and the tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes until the tomato is broken down. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves crushing them between your fingers, add some lemon juice and serve. If you like, you can garnish with some coriander, too!

These little coconut balls are one of my favourite things to serve during christmas. The original recipe called for egg and then required some baking, but I decided to substitute the egg to avoid the baking part!

They are incredibly easy to make, healthy, and so delicious!

<ul>
  <li>250 g mashed sweet potato (baked, microwaved or boiled sweet potato, then mashed with a fork)</li>
  <li>150 g sugar or to taste (can be substituted for stevia)</li>
  <li>30 g powdered biscuits, tea-biscuit or wafer type (mine were low on sugar and vanilla flavour)</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp vainilla extract (can be omitted if the biscuits are flavoured)</li>
  <li>150 g shredded coconut</li>
  <li>Some extra shredded coconut, to coat the balls</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Mix all the ingredients to make a smooth mixture. If it is not thick enough to form the balls, add some more powdered biscuits.
  2. Form some balls and then coat them with the shredded coconut.
  3. Let it cold down a little bit in the fridge before serving it so they harden a little bit.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/467/31326276880_2d9bbb8d21_k_d.jpg" />

This is my all-time favourite apple spongecake - eggless, and can be easily adapted into a vegan version. It is so moist and fluffy and lemony, and the pieces of baked apple are perfectly tender. 

This can be made using exclusively vegetable oil (I usually use sunflower oil), but I like to lighten it up substituting half with yoghurt, and it turns out just as fluffy as the full-oil version. Use applesauce instead of yoghurt for a vegan version!


<ul>
  <li>180 g flour (I used whole wheat flour)</li>
  <li>30 g cornstarch</li>
  <li>16 g baking powder</li>
  <li>150 g sugar (I used 100 g and then added a bit of stevia)</li>
  <li>150 g milk (you can use almond milk if you want to make a vegan cake)</li>
  <li>120 g vegetable oil (1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp) or you can sub half with unsweetened yoghurt or with unsweetened applesauce</li>
  <li>The lemon peel grind of one lemon</li>
  <li>125-150 g of apple (I use one whole golden apple)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180 C
  2. In a bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch and the baking powder. In a different bowl, mix the oil, lemon peel grind and the sugar. 
  3. Take a spoonful of the flour mixture and mix it with the apple to coat the cubes. Leave on the side.
  4. Pour the oil mixture over the flour mixture and mix, without overmixing it (or else the final result will be tough); then, add the apples and mix them in. 
  5. Pour in a greased mold. If desired, put some apple pieces on top to decorate. 
  6. Bake for 30-40 minutes, depending on the mold and the oven, until when inserting a knife in the middle, it comes out clean.

"Sobrasada" is a typical spanish spread made primarily of pork fat and paprika. Quite honestly, it has always been one of my soft points: I love it! So when I found out there were recipes for vegan "sobrasada" made with sundried tomatoes, I had to give it a go. 

I use two different recipes depending on what I have available at home, this one uses oats. It tastes like spicy paprika, and oregano, and olive oil... just try it already!

<ul>
  <li>50 g sundried tomatoes (NOT the ones that come in oil)</li>
  <li>20 g rolled oats (1/4 cup)</li>
  <li>1 cc paprika, sweet or spicy depending on your taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder or half a garlic clove</li>
  <li>Optional: extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt and some black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process** 

  1. Hydrate the tomatoes and oats in warm water (not boiling) for 15 minutes. 
  2. Drain very well.
  3. Process all the ingredients and let it cool down in the fridge beefore serving.
    
**Spread it on bread, make sobrasada and cheese sandwiches... whatever you like most!**

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src= "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/273/31698838425_d6a909cc53_o_d.jpg" />

One of my favourite vegetarian foods is palak paneer, a spinach and cheese curry. There is only one minor problem with it, and it is precisely one of its key ingredients: Paneer.

Don't get me wrong. I love it. But I cannot seem to be able to find it in stores, trying to replace it with other cheeses just leads to weird-looking attempts at the recipe, and making the paneer myself... well. has anyone tried to make paneer from scratch on a busy week?
Um... not very practical. 

So, the ultimate way to make palak paneer is to not make palak paneer at all, but to make palak TOFU. Yup, you read that right. Tofu actually has quite a neutral flavour that works very well with the spices of the dish, it holds its shape properly, gives nice texture and colour, and from a nutritional point of view, I quite prefer it to the paneer. 

I know this may sound strange, but seriously: my lovely indian boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, and he was so impressed that I had actually taken the time to make the paneer from scratch... it was only after several times of making it that I told him it was tofu! 


<ul>
  <li>300 g paneer or tofu (if using tofu: freeze and defreeze so it firms up)</li>
  <li>450 g frozen chopped spinach</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil (3 if using tofu)</li>
  <li>1/2 big onion,  finely chopped (75 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or 2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 green chili, desseded and sliced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 bay leafs or 1 big indian bay leaf</li> 
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp red chili powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp heavy whipping cream (4 tbsp if using tofu)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dry fenugreek leaves (you can leave it out and maybe add 1&2 tsp cinnamon and garnish with coriander, but the flavor will be very different)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cook the spinach according to the package instructions (I cook mine in the microwave). 
  2. In a pan, put some oil (1/2-1 tbsp) with the whole spices and the chili. Once they start warming up, add the garlic, ginger and onion, with a pinch of salt. 
  3. Brown in the pan for about 10 minutes until the onion is tender. Then, add the powdered spices and cook for one minute. 
  4. Add the spinach with some water and salt. Let cook for 5 minutes. 
  5. Add the tofu and let cook together for a couple of minutes. 
  6. Let it cook until the water has evaporated to the consistency of the gravy you like. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the yoghurt and the fenugreek leaves and serve.

<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup + 1/4 flour (I use whole wheat)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup sugar (or more to taste)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp vanilla sugar</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tbsp unsweetened peanut butter</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
  <li>2 tsp strawberry jam</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp corn starch</li>
  <li>1-3 tbsp milk or water</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 tsp vanilla and/or 1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
 </ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, sugar and vanilla sugar.
  2. Add the peanut butter and mix thoroughly.
  3. Add 1 tbsp milk or water and mix. Add liquid a little at a time.
  4. In a bowl, put the jam and heat it up in the microwave for 5-10 seconds. Once it's runny, mix with the cornstarch.
  5. Form the cookies and lay on parchment paper; it should form 10-12 cookies.
     - _Watch the video for specifics on how to give them the shape._
  6. Cook in the microwave for about 90 (time depends on the microwave so be careful!)
  7. Take out of the microwave and gently spoon a little bit of jam mixture into the central hole. 
  8. Microwave for further 20 seconds approximately. 
    * If overcooked, they get tough and dry! 

Let them rest at least 15 minutes (better 30 or 60) for best results.

This can be used to substitute couscous or rice as a sidedish, as well as in some recipes. I usually either make it in the microwave with some salt, or stir fry it with a bit of oil. I will post some of the things I like to make, but would love to hear your ideas!

<ul>
  <li>1 cauliflower, fresh, cut into florets, clean and dry</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  - If using a **foodprocessor**: rinse the cauliflower florets and, once dry, introduce in the processor (2-3 batches per cauliflower) and process until you get a rice or couscous consistency, abouy 30-60 seconds. 
  - If using a **mixer**: rinse the cauliflower and introduce in batches in the standing mixer with some water and mix; once acquired the desired texture, drain. 
  - If using a **grater**: rince the cauliflower properly and grate patiently.

This is a great filling for a wrap. You can use a crepe-type wrap like I did, or other things like tortillas, chapati or dosa to keep it vegan.
<ul>
  <li>1 cup flour (whole wheat or all-purpose flour)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>Three tomatos</li>
  <li>Half an onion or one shalot, fresh parsley or coriander, salt</li>
  <li>One avocado</li>
  <li>400 g of cooked red kidney beans.</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp tomato paste, to taste. If not available, can be substituted for fresh tomato (but will require longer cooking time).</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste (1/2 tsp)</li>
  <li>Spices, to taste: 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 onion.</li>
  <li>Chili, to taste. I use 3-4 fresh chilies, taking the seeds out.</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. To form the crepe mixture, mix the dry ingredients, add the egg, mix and then add the water (1-1.5 cups), a little bit at a time, until you get a thin consistency. Let it sit for 10-15 min. Then cook in a very lightly greased nonstick pan on medium-high heat.
  2. For the tomato mixture, chop the tomatoes, half an onion, parsley or coriander and salt and mix; do not add the salt until the very end to prevent the tomato from releasing water.
     - _If the raw onion flavour is too much, put the chopped onion in cold water for 10-15 min before using._
  3. To prepare the avocado: slice it, add some lemon juice, salt and pepper and mix.
  4. To prepare the filling: 
     - Fry the onion, if using; then, add all the ingredients at the same time. 
     - _I use the red kidney beans with the liquid from the jar too, but if you want to, you can substitute it for water._
     - Cook on medium heat, stirring, until the mixture is quite thick.
  6. Fill the crepes with the tomato, avocado and beans, wrap it up and eat! 

A perfect recipe for meatless days!

<ul>
  <li>200 g cooked rice</li>
  <li>50 g flour</li>
  <li>50 g yogurt</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste (1/4 tsp)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Put all the ingredients in a container. 
  2. Add about 1/4 cup of water and blend. Add more water a bit at a time.
  3. Blend until you get a smooth consistency, like crepe batter.
  4. Let it sit for 10 minutes. 
  5. In a nonstick pan on medium-high heat, slightly greased, pour a splash of the batter. 
  6. Tilt the pan to the sides so the batter distributes properly.
  7. Leave 1-2 minutes on that side and then flip over with a espatula.
     - Be careful in this step because dosas could break.
     - If it does break, pour a little bit of batter on the crack and let it set.
  8. Cook on the other side for two more minutes and transfer into a plate.

Serve plain with chutney or stuff it!

<ul>
  <li>1 cup dal (dry lentils); I like using red lentils, which cook fast</li>
  <li>3 onions</li>
  <li>Optional: tomato, peppers or any veggies lying around the kitchen</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh green chillies to taste (I use 3)</li>
  <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste (about 2 garlic cloves)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tsp  garam masala (to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Optional, to garnish: lemon, fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. En a casserole, put water with a pinch of turmeric and the dal; once boiling, cover and simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally.
  2. Meanwhile, in a pan, add some oil and the cumin seeds. 
  3. Once the cumin is golden, add the chili and onions (and any other vegetable you might use that takes long to cook).
  4. Cook on medium heat until the onion is tender. 
  5. Add the garlic and the ginger paste and cook stirring for a minute.
  6. Add the other spices.
     * _At this point you could add soft vegetables such as tomatoes and let them cook for a couple of minutes._
  7. Cook about 30 sec-1 min, then turn off the heat. 
  8. During this time, the dal should've been cooking; the simmering time depends on the type of lentil and your taste (30-60min)
     * _I don't mind if my dal stil has some texture to it, but if you leave it long enough, it will form a puree like in the video_
     * _If the dal is too liquid, turn up the heat and cook uncovered a couple of minutes; if it's too dense, add a splash of water._
  9. Mix in the vegetables with the dal and cook together for 5-10 minutes.

Serve with a splash of lemon juice and some fresh coriander.

This is a very popular snack from Gujrat: a savory spongecake made with chickpeas.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup chana dal / chickpeas - soaked overnight</li>
  <li>3 tbsp yogurt (best if left overnight outside of the fridge so it is more sour)</li>
  <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 tbsp green chili-ginger paste or 2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 cup water _start with half, then add slowly</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/8 tsp turmeric (but if you use too much, the dhokla might end up pink!)</li>
  <li>1'5 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>For the tadka: 1 tbsp oil, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 1 tsp sesame seeds , red chili to taste, Opcional:asafoetida, 2 tbsp water, 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice , Optional: 4 seedless green chillies cut lenghtwise, curry leaves</li>
  <li>To serve: 1 tbsp coconut (better if fresh), fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**

1. Drain the soaked chickpeas, put in a food processor, add half a cup of water and the yogurt and process until you have a thick but smooth batter. Add water (a little at a time) if necessary. Then, let the batter outside in a warm place for 5-6 hours (you should see some bubbles appear).
2. Add the lemon, salat, ginger and turmeric to the fermented mixture. Mix.
3. Grease the mold you will be using (one big round one or two small square ones).
4. Add the baking soda (from now on you have to be fast as the reaction has already started), mix VERY well and pour on a mold.
5. Microwave for 4 minutes (I used two different molds and microwaved them separately) until set, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Original version: steam for about 10-15 minutes
6. Meanwhile, prepare the tadka: first fry the mustard seeds in the oil; when they start to pop add the sesame, take off the stove, add the asafoetida, let it cool down, then add the other ingredients.
7. Once it has set, pout the tadka over the top with a spoon so it is well distributed.
8. To finish, sprinkle the coconut and coriander over the top.

* Serve in squares with your favorite chutney (mint, tamarind or green chutney)

<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
  <li>2-3 green chillies / dried red chillies</li>
  <li>1/2 a lemon, squeezed (1 tbsp lemon juice)</li>
  <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 inch piece cinnamon</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 black cardamom</li>
  <li>2 tsp roasted cumin powder (dry roast in a pan for about 5 minutes, then powder)</li>
  <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cup black tea (let the tea bag in the hot water for 3 minutes)</li>
  <li>2 roma tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/4 cup onion, chopped (plus extra for garnishing)</li>
  <li>2 cans canned chickpeas/ garbanzo beans, drained and washed - about 500-600 grams</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
</ul>
* **Process**

  1. In a big enough saucepan, heat the oil. Add in the cinnamon, bay leaves, black cardamom and cumin seeds (and dried red chillies if using any). 
  2. Cook for 30 seconds until the aroma develops.
  3. Add the ginger, garlic and green chillies. Cook stirring for 30 seconds.
  4. Add the onions and cook on medium heat, covered, until soft.
  5. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5-10 minutes.
  6. Pour the tea and the chickpeas into the pan. Add salt to taste and the rest of spices. 
  7. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
  8. Add the lemon juice, test to adjust seasoning. 
  9. Mix the coriander leaves, garnish with raw onion and serve with lemon slices.

_The best to use is red onion for the garnishing; if non available, I recommend leaving them in cold water for 10 minutes so their taste gets milder._

<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup + 1/4 flour</li>
  <li>1/4 cup sugar (or less to taste)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/2-1 tbsp vegetal or coconut oil</li>
  <li>2 tbsp dissecated coconut</li>
  <li>1-3 tbsp coconut milk (or regular milk)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 tsp vanilla and/or 1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, sugar and coconur.
  2. Add the oil and mix thoroughly with a spoon.
  3. Add 1 tbsp coconut milk (and vanilla extract if using) and mix. Add milk a little at a time.
  4. Form the biscuits and lay on parchment paper (makes 10 small or 5 big biscuits).
  5. _Optional, but should be done: eat everything left behind in the bowl and spoon!_ :)
  6. Cook in the microwave for about 90-120 seconds (time depends on the microwave so be careful!)
     - In the beggining the might look undercooked; let them sit for 10 minutes before eating. 
     - If overcooked, they get tough and dry!

<ul>
  <li>500 g cooked red kidney beans</li>
  <li>2 tbsp besan (chickpea flour) - can be subbed for oat flour or breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt (start with less and adjust to taste)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp chili</li>
  <li>Optional: a bit of Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander </li>
  <li>Optional: breadcrumbs with salt to coat the burguers</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. With a fork, mash the beans to get a paste that still has some texture. 
  2. Add the rest of ingredients. 
  3. Form the “burguers” using your wet hands. 
     - _Optional: coat with breadcrubs, which makes the forming easier._ 
  4. Cook in an oiled pan over medium-high heat, not moving it in the first few minutes.


Serve with **avocado**, chipotle sauce, or whatever you like!

Summer is coming. And that means... ice cream! And my favorite ice cream is Kulfi: an indian milk-based, egg-free ice cream that is usually flavored with cardamom and other ingredients such as saffron (kesar), pistachios or mango. 

Kulfi is usually made with milk, but my low carb version uses heavy cream (or coconut cream for vegans) and almond milk to keep it low carb. It is a bit harder then its high carb version, so I would recommend you make it with a stick (popsicle style) rather than to eat with a spoon. But either way, I am sure you will enjoy it!

And if you like my recipes, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe), which will also give you access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* 2/3 cups of heavy whipping cream or coconut cream (160g), chilled in the fridge
* 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk
* Stevia or erythritol or sucralose
* Seeds from 2 green cardamoms, powdered
* A good pinch of saffron (optional)
* 1/4 tsp xantham gum (optional)
* 30 g of roasted almonds or pistachios (optional)


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Put the almond milk in a small pot. Heat it up until it almost boils (but dont get it there as it could curdle!), then add the spices and sweetener (equivalent to 3-4 tbsp sugar). Let the aromas infuse.
  2. Let the mixture cool.
  3. Whip the cream until it forms peaks. 
  4. Mix the almond milk with the xantham gum (you might have to blend it to avoid lumps), then add it to the whipped cream slowly. 
  5. Once everything is mixed, taste it and add more sweetener if necessary. Then divide into four containers and freeze. 
  6. Serve once frozen with some chopped nuts on top (optional).

A few weeks ago my sister made some amazing roasted Cherry tomatoes. I tried a little bit and loved it, but was so disappointed when I found out they had sugar... 

So I decided to make my own version - skipping the sugar and the balsamic vinegar, this becomes a wonderful low-carb addition to your favorite salads or a delicious side for meat. 

And if you like my recipes, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe), which will also give you access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* 3 cups of lettuce (90g)
* 60 g chicken breast, cooked (half a breast)
* 30 g bacon, cooked
* 1 boiled egg
* 1/2 avocado
* 2 tbsp mayonnaise
* 1/2 tsp tomato purée
* 1/3 tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* Stevia to taste (equivalent to 1/2 tsp sugar)
* Optional: chipotle chili
* Freshly ground black pepper



<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Mix the mayo, tomato purée, mustard, lemon, stevia, chili and black pepper with a generous pinch of salt until you have a smooth dressing. 
  2. Put all the ingredients into a plate. Top with your dressing. Eat.

Not eating eggs when on a ketogenic diet can be very taxing, since most breakfast involve eggs. 

But now, you can make low carb and egg free omelets, customising the filling to your taste. 

And if you like my recipes, don't forget to [subscribe](http://maria.recipes/subscribe), which will also give you access to the **Keto Recipe Recommender**. 

* 1/6 cup (2 tbsp + 2 tsp) chickpea flour (20 g)
* 1/6 cup protein powder, flavor free (18 g) (I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">unflavored whey</a>)
* 1/9 cup (1 tbsp + 2 tsp) flax seeds, ground (18g)
* 1/8 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 cup water
* 3 oz (90 g) of goat cheese
* 3 cups (90g) of fresh spinach
* 3 tbsp oil 
* Pinch of salt and pepper


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Put half of the oil in a non stick pan on medium heat. Add the spinach with salt and pepper and cook for two minutes until wilted, then transfer to a plate and divide into three.
  2. Whisk the chickpea flour, flax meal, protein powder and water with salt and pepper (add the water slowly to avoid overdoing it, and add more if necessary); you should end up with a thick batter. Put the other half of the oil in the pan and add one third of the mixture. 
  3. Move the pan to ensure it covers the whole pan, then in one half put the spinach and the cheese. 
  4. Cook on medium-low until the egg is almost set, then fold on itself. 
  5. Take out of the pan, proceed in the same manner for the other two omelets and serve.

  2. Mix all the ingredients for the filling. 
  3. Divide the dough into five and the filling into five.

  5. Put a portion of the stuffing on one of the disks, lightly water the edges, then put the other disk on top. Use the rolling pin to seal the edges, very carefully so it doesnt break. Then, gently roll the whole paratha.
  6. Cook like you would a normal paratha, using 1 tsp of oil.

This is what I call my Lazy Seekh Kebab: just mix up some spices with meat, then cook it in the pan with veggies. No tandoori, no long cooking process, but still incredible flavor!

  3. Chop the rest of the vegetables. 
  4. Put 1/2 tbsp oil in a pan on high heat, then add the vegetables and cook for 2 minutes. 
  5. Now lower the heat to medium, add in the kebabs and cover with a lid. 
  6. Cook for about 2 minutes, then turn the kebabs 90 degrees and move the veggies so they don't burn. Proceed until you have done all four sides. 
  7. Serve with some mint chutney.

Alfredo is a classic Pasta dish that people often avoid because it is full of cream and cheese... Which is good news for us, keto-ers! Simply use zoodles instead of pasta and you will end up with a delicious, 15 minute meal.


* 2 medium zucchini (400g), spiralized to form zoodles
* 150 g chicken breast, in strips
* 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream (180g)
* 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, grated (60g)
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3/4 tsp onion powder
* 3/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 chicken bouillon cube
* Black pepper to taste


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Put the butter in the pan and use it to brown the chicken, which should take about 5 minutes. 
  2. Add the zoodles and cook another 2 minutes until they get a bit soft (do not overcook or they will release water).
  3. Optional: take out the chicken and zoodles from the pan, then add the cream and cook about 5 minutes to reduce it. 
  4. Add all the ingredients into the pan and cook it together for 1 minute or so.
  5. Enjoy the creamy goodness.

My take at Mac And Cheese, Ketofied with cauliflower. Even the vegetable haters will give in to this cheesiness delight!


* 1 medium head of cauliflower, cut into bite-sized pieces (600g)
* 2,5 heaping tbsp of cream cheese (75g)
* 1,5 cups of shredded cheddar (170g)
* 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream (180g)
* 1/4 tsp Dijon mustard
* Salt and black pepper
* Optional: chives or other herbs


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Boil or steam the cauliflower until just fork tender. Do not overcook it! 
  2. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  3. Mix all the ingredients except the cauliflower to form a paste. It will be quite thick. Then mix in the cauliflower. It will seem a bit too thick to mix in but don't worry - when the cheese melts, it will all be good. 
  4. Put into a greased baking tray. 
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes until the top is nice and golden.

A very simple meal. My mother used to make this for us for dinner in the weekdays, since it barely took any time but was delicious. Enjoy it with some [salad](http://maria.recipes/simpleSalad) or with [cauliflower rice](http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice) on the side.


* 2 skinless chicken breasts, cubed (240g)
* 20-25 g roquefort or blue cheese
* 60 g heavy whipping cream
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 cup of canned and drained mushrooms (160g)
* Salt, pepper


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil, then add the chicken to brown with some salt and pepper for about 2-3 minutes. 
  2. Add the mushrooms and cook everything on low until the chicken is no longer raw.
  3. Meanwhile, mix or blend the cheese with the cream. Add 1-2 tbsp of water if necessary (but no more as it thins out when you add it to the pan later).
  4. Now, add the sauce to the pan, let it all cook together for a minute, and serve.

Alfredo is a classic Pasta dish that people often avoid because it is full of cream and cheese... Which is good news for us, keto-ers! Simply use zoodles instead of pasta and you will end up with a delicious, 15 minute meal.


* 2 medium zucchini (400g), spiralized to form zoodles
* 2 cups of whole white mushrooms (200g), cut into bite sized pieces
* 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream (180g)
* 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated (60g)
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3/4 tsp onion powder
* 3/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 vegetable bouillon cube
* 1/2 Scoop of neutral flavor Whey Powder
* Black pepper to taste


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Put the butter in the pan and use it to cook the mushrooms until tender (about 5 minutes). 
  2. Add the zoodles and cook another 2 minutes until they get a bit soft (do not overcook or they will release water).
  3. Optional: take out the mushrooms and zoodles from the pan, then add the cream and cook about 5 minutes to reduce it. 
  4. Add all the ingredients into the pan and cook it together for 1 minute or so.
  5. Enjoy the creamy goodness.

A simple summery salad that you can customize to fit into your nutritional restrictions. I am suggesting a version with eggs and another one egg-free, but you could use chicken instead of eggs, and if you are a vegan, you could substitute the Feta cheese for Tofu feta (tofu cubed and marinated in apple cider vinegar, lemon, salt and oregano), adding some extra oil.

* 1 small cucumber, chopped (160g)
* 1 small tomato, chopped (100g)
* 1/4 small red onion, chopped (15g)
* 10 black olives, preferably kalamata (30g)
* 50 g feta cheese, cubed
* 2 tbsp <a href="amzn.to/2otU1I8">hemp hearts</a> (30g) OR 2 boiled eggs
* Dried or fresh oregano
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* Salt and pepper to taste

This is seriously the best pizza. You have to try!

* 1 pizza base, such as my 
<a href="http://maria.recipes/ketoPizza">Flax Pizza</a>
* 4 tbsp of <a href="http://maria.recipes/bbq">keto BBQ sauce</a> (1/8 of the sauce recipe)
* 2/3 cup shredded mozzarella (80g)
* 80 g raw chicken, chopped
* 20 g red onion, thinly sliced
* Fresh coriander


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Make the pizza base as per your recipe.
  2. Take out the cooked pizza base, top with the BBQ sauce, then the mozzarella, then the chicken and onion. Put it back in the oven. 
  3. Cook until the chicken is no longer raw (about 5-10 minutes).
  4. Take it out, top with fresh coriander and enjoy.

I am all about fast recipes lately. This one takes 15-20 minutes, including the chopping time! 

If you like fried rice, try my <a href="http://maria.recipes/mushroomRice">Mushroom fried rice</a>!

* 1 and 1/2 cups of <a href="maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauli-rice</a>

* 0.5 tbsp sesame oil
* 2/3 tbsp soy sauce
* 90 g chicken breast, chopped
* 1/2 star anise, whole (optional, but gives very nice chinese flavor)

<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil and use it to fry the white part of the spring onions, the chili, star anise and the bell pepper. 
  2. After about 5 minutes, when the spring onion is golden, add ginger and cook for 1 minute. 
  3. Then, add the chicken and brown it for about 2-3 minutes. 
  4. Now add the cauli-rice with some black pepper and salt (or you can sprinkle about 1/8 of a chicken bouillon cube). Cook for about 2 minutes. 
  5. Add the soy sauce and cook another 2-3 minutes or until the cauli-rice is tender.
  6. Turn off the stove, add the green parts of the onions and serve.

The classic Tikka recipe that I had <a href="http://maria.recipes/tikkaEng">already uploaded</a>, now lower carb to make it even more keto friendly. Eat it as an appetizer, with salad or make some <a href="http://maria.recipes/tikkaMasalaEng">Paneer Tikka Masala</a>!


* 100 g paneer, cubed
* 1/8 cup (30 g) of heavy cream
* 1/4 tsp ginger paste
* 1/2 tsp lemon juice
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* Optional: 1/4 tsp fried fenugreek leaves
* 1/3 tsp cumin powder
* 1/3 tsp coriander powder
* 1/4 tsp red chili powder
* 1/4 tsp chaat masala
* 1/4 tsp garam masala
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp oil, for cooking


<!-- -->

* **Process**
  1. Mix all the ingredients except the paneer. Then add the paneer and let it marinate for at least an hour, preferably overnight, in the fridge.
  2. You can make this in the oven, but I like to cook it over high heat with the oil until very brown and crispy. 
  3. Sprinkle with coriander leaves and serve.

Cheesy quiche was one of my favorite meals before going low carb. So being able to make my own low carb version of them is just amazing. And believe me, this is just as bit as good as the real deal. Give it a try!

<!-- -->

  2. Warm up the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and zucchini with salt and pepper and cook for about 15 minutes until tender.
  3. Blend the eggs with the cream.
  4. Put the zucchini mixture and the cheese over the crust, evenly distributed. Then pour the egg mixture over the top. 
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is set.

Another take at Egg Curry. This is my mother-in-law's style, frying the boiled eggs to get a hard, crunchy coating. Perfect for keto-ers!

Ever since I was a kid, my mom would make lamb or fish "en cuajadera": roasted with white wine, potatos and vegetables. By omitting the potatoes, this is a delicious and complete meal, perfect for a ketogenic diet. 

<ul>
  <li>One Leg of lamb (if boneless should be 450 g meat)</li>
  <li>1 medium zucchini, sliced (180g)</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, sliced (110g)</li>
  <li>1 cup of chopped tomato (150 g)</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
  <li>150 mL of dry white wine</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>A handful of parsley</li>
  <li>Salt, ground black pepper, dry thyme</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
  2. Chop the vegetables. Place on a greased baking tray. Then put the lamb on top and add the rest of the ingredients.   
  3. Bake for about 90 minutes (depending on the size of the lamb piece), turning it around after half the time, until the meat is tender.

This is such an easy recipe I wasn't even sure if I should upload it! These wraps take about 5 minutes to put together and are incredibly tasty. You can add other ingredients to taste, such as chopped pickles, or you could add 50 g of cooked chopped prawns to have a serving of 30 g of protein.  


<ul>
  <li>3 collard greens, stem removed (50g)</li>
  <li>55 g tinned tuna (in brine) (solids only)</li>
  <li>One boiled egg</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise (30g)</li>
  <li>1/4 avocado (50 g)</li>
  <li>7 green olives, chopped</li>
  <li>Optional: black pepper, ground chili</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Prepare the collard greens by removing the stem. You can chop it off altogether, or you can put the leaf on a chopping board and then trim the stem horizontally like you would when making [cabbage rolls](http://maria.recipes/ketoCabbageRolls). 
  2. Mash the avocado with a fork, then mix all the ingredients for the filling. Divide into three. 
  3. Put one part of the filling into the edge of the collard leaf, then wrap as if you were making [cabbage rolls](http://maria.recipes/ketoCabbageRolls). You can secure the wraps with toothpicks if you want to have them on the go.

Soul bread is a very popular option for ketoers who miss sandwiches and toast. This is my take at it, which results in a spongy, soft, slightly sweet bread, amazing for grilled cheese! With these amounts you will get pieces of bread on the smaller side, so if you want bigger slices, just double all the ingredients and use the same breadloaf pan. 

<ul>
  <li>6 heaping tablespoons of cream cheese (180 g)</li>
  <li>80 g unflavored whey protein</li>
  <li>1/8 cup olive oil (27 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup of greek yogurt (31 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup heavy whipping cream (30 g)</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 and 1/4 tsp psyllium husk powder (3 g)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  2. Blend the eggs, yogurt, cream, oil, vinegar and cream cheese. 
  3. Mix the whey protein, salt, baking powder and psyllium husk powder. 
  4. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ones and mix well.
  5. Pour onto a greased breadloaf pan (if you prefer, you can put some parchment paper on the inside of the pan instead of greasing it).
  6. Bake at 180C for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. If it starts getting too golden on the top, cover with aluminum foil to avoid it burning.
  7. Wait until it is completely cooled down to slice.

_For those who miss dumplings... this is your recipe!_

Momos are steamed dumplings made in Tibet and Nepal, and very popular as a snack in India. They are usually made with a white flour dough and served with very spicy sauce; I actually have the traditional recipe in one of my oldest posts, from back when I ate low fat high carb... 

So now I decided to make a new, improved, low carb version! The filling is made with chicken, buttter and zucchini; I like the zucchini to add some extra moisture, but you can leave it out and increase the chicken and butter to make an even more keto version. The dough is made mixing ground sesame seeds, psyllium husk and coconut flour (you can use all coconut flour following the recipe for my [coconut flour roti](http://maria.recipes/coconutRoti) but I didn't want my momo to taste like coconut!). I almost didn't upload these because they turned out purple... but I read that this can be caused by the psyllium husk and it can depend on the brand. And even if they come out purple, these are delicious!

<ul>
  <li>75 g minced chicken</li>
  <li>25 g shredded zucchini</li>
  <li>1 tbsp(15 g) butter</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/8 tsp ground fenugreek (methi)</li>
  <li>Optional: pinch of chili to taste</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp ground ginger</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp ground garlic</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp ground onion</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped scallions (10 g)</li>
  <li>55 g ground sesame seeds</li>
  <li>2 tsp oil</li>
  <li>3,5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (28 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup (15 g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a></li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Mix the ingredients for the filling: chicken, butter, zucchini, spices, soy sauce and 1/8 tsp salt. If you want to check for salt, take a small amount of the filling and cook in a pan, then taste it. 
  2. Mix the ground sesame, <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> and 1/4 tsp salt. Then add the oil and water, starting with 1/4 cup of water and adding more little by little until you have a dough you can shape. 
  3. Take a piece of dough slightly smaller than a goldball. With a rolling pin, roll it to 2-3 mm thick; you can add a bit of water if the dough is dry and crumbling. Then trim the edges to make a 10 cm diameter disk. 
  4. Put a teaspoon of filling in the centre and then form the momo as seen in the video. 
  5. Once all the momos are formed, steam them for about 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked inside.
  6. Serve with spicy chutney, like [this one](http://maria.recipes/acharEng)!

A simple, 5 ingredient recipe to make broccoli parathas stuffed with cream cheese. They are amazing with some pickle for breakfast! And if you are vegan, you can use some almond cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese. 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 bunch of broccoli (250 g)</li>
  <li>3,5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (28 g)</li>
  <li>A big pinch of salt</li>
  <li>8 tbsp (120g) cream cheese (you can substitute for paneer if you want)</li>
  <li>4 tsp ghee</li>
  <li>Spices to taste (optional)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Cook the broccoli (boil or steam) until fork tender, without overcooking so it doesnt lose the green color.
  2. Blend the broccoli with 2 tbsp water. 
  3. Add the <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> and salt to the broccoli puree, along with other spices if you want (some garlic powder and onion powder could be great!) and mix until you have a dough. 
  4. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. 
  5. Using a chakla or a rolling pin (i like to cover my surface with plastic wrap to avoid any stickiness - by putting a bit of water on the surface first, the plastic wrap won't move when you roll), roll each part into a very thin disk of about 1 mm thickness. 
  6. Take a disk, spread 2 tbsp cheese on it, then put another disk on top. Pinch the edges to seal. 
  7. Melt 1 tsp of ghee on a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook the paratha for 3-4 minutes on one side until it is brown, then filp and cook further 2-3 minutes. 
  8. Cook all four parathas this way and serve with a low carb pickle.

  <li>1-2 garlic cloves very finely chopped</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper, nutmeg</li>
  <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley</li>
  <li>1 cup of tomato puree or one big tomato (180g)</li>
  <li>60 mL white wine, or half white wine and half cherry or similar wine</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix all the ingredients for the filling and keep in the fridge for at least 30 min: meat, egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg, parsley, garlic and white or cherry wine.
  2. Preheat the oven to 200C.
  3. Open the peppers on the top (creating a lid) and throw away the seeds inside.
  4. Use the meat mixture to fill the peppers.
  5. Blend (or finely chop) the tomato and onion (you can use half the oil in the recipe to fry the onion) and pour over the peppers. Then add the remaining oil and white wine. 
  6. Bake for about 40 minutes or until the pepper is tender and the meat is cooked through.

Raw cabbage is delicious for salads. And when combined with sauteed tofu and a tahini dressing, it makes an amazing meal. Even my mom, who is a bit skeptical about cabbage, kept saying it was amazing!


<ul>
  <li>1 cup shredded cabbage (70 g)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup shredded purple cabbage (35 g)</li>
  <li>125 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt (or more to taste)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black salt (kala namak) (sub for regular salt if not available)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/4 garlic clove (or less, to taste)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tahini</li>
  <li>Stevia or other sweetener to taste</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp water</li>
  <li>Spicy Paprika, Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the cubed tofu with the black salt and some black pepper, and fry for 10-15 minutes until it is golden and slightly crunchy.
  2. Meanwhile, chop the cabbabe.
  3. Mix all the other ingredients except the paprika to make the dressing. If you aren’t a big garlic fan, leave it in a big chunk and let it infuse, then take out before eating.
  4. Add half of the dressing to the cabbage and mix well to cover it.
  5. Once the tofu is done, serve on top of the cabbage, add the rest of the dressing and some paprika, and serve while it is still warm.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src= "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2718/32865236166_44a912cebe_o_d.jpg" />

Most low-carb breads use eggs, and the only vegan ones I have come across all contain vital wheat gluten. I don't mind consuming gluten every now and then, but I like having some paleo vegan options available as well. 

This recipe is a godsend. The texture of these breadbuns are amazing! The only issue with these in my opinion is that the agar gives a bit of an aftertaste, but you can substitute the agar eggs for flax eggs instead, which would also decrease the carbcount significantly.

Little tip: if the bread seem to be puffing up a lot in the oven, but they deflate and end up being empty inside when they cool down, try reducing the baking powder a little bit.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup of almond flour (110 g)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a> (30 g)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp agar flakes OR <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a> ground + 6 tbsp boiling water (can be substituted for 3 egg whites if not vegan)</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 and 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1,5 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>2 cups of boiling water</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 200C. 
  2. Mix the agar with the 6 tbsp water. If it doesn't dissolve, put in the microwave for a minute until it is well dissolved and very thick.
  3. Mix all the dry ingredients. Put them in a food processor and add the agar. Mix until you have a crumbly dough. 
  4. Add 1,5 cups of water and mix. Add the rest of the water as needed to get a sticky and firm dough. 
  5. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form little balls with them. 
  6. Put in a baking tray and bake for 40 minutes or until when you tap the bottom, they sound hollow.

This was one of my favorite winter soups before going low carb. I used to only use butternut squash, but since it is quite high in carbs, I decided to mix it with cauliflower to lower the carb count, and the final result is fantastic! Hope you give it a go!

<ul>
  <li>200 g (1,5 cups) butternut squash, chopped</li>
  <li>200 g (2 cups) cauliflower, chopped</li>
  <li>35 g onion</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
  <li>2 cups of broth of choice</li>
  <li>1/3 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil. Add the onion and ginger and fry for 2 minutes. 
  2. Add the rest of ingredients. Boil in an open pot for about 20 minutes, or in a pressure cooker for 8 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. 
  3. Use a hand blender to smoothen it. Add more liquid if you like it thinner. 
  4. Serve inmediately.

Soy is almost unavoidable in a vegetarian diet, especially for lowcarbers. But a lot of people are alergic, others are intolerant, and other people like me don't want to base all their nourishment on a single ingredient...

But here comes Chickpea Tofu to the rescue!

The original recipe is from Birmania: a tofu made from chickpea flour that is served as is in salads. I modified it a bit, reducing the amount of chickpea flour and incorporating some flax and protein powder to make it lower carb and higher protein. 

The result are tofu cubes with a very delicate flavor and texture, that can be sauteed in oil, which makes them slightly crunchy on the outside but still pillowy in the inside. A real delicacy!

My favorite way of having them is sauteed with coconut oil and spices, served warm over salad with some fresh coriander. Yum.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) chickpea flour</li>
  <li>50g flavor free protein powder (like <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">unflavored whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (50g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>1/2-2/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/4-1/3 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients. Then add one cup of the water and mix until you have a batter/paste. 
  2. Take the rest of the water to a boil. When it starts boiling, gently add in the batter while whisking. 
  3. Keep simmering while whisking for about 8 minutes, until it is as thick as clay. You can whisk in the beginning, then switch to a spatula when it gets thicker. 
  4. Pour in a lightly greased mold and let it cool down in the fridge for at least one hour.

When people think of indian food, they very rarely think of fish dishes, but in certain parts of the country like Bengal or Mumbai, fish curries are a staple in every household. This one in particular is my favorite, as the coconut milk makes for a super creamy sauce.

<ul>
  <li>500 g cod or other similar fish, cut in chunks</li>
  <li>3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 dried red chili (or one green chili chopped to be added with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
  <li>1/2 medium onion (50 g)</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (150 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garlic paste or 4 cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>3/4 cups coconut milk</li>
  <li>Optional: 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander to garnish</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oil in a pan over medium high heat. Fry the mustard seeds and dried red chili.
  2. When the seeds start to pop, wait about one minute, then add the garlic, ginger and onions with a bit of salt. Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes until they are translucent.
  3. Add the chopped tomatoes with salt. Cook for 5 minutes until they break down. 
  4. Add the fish with the rest of the salt. 
  5. Turn up the stove to high heat to cook the fish for about 2 minutes. Add the spices. Mix and cook for 30 seconds, then add the coconut milk.
  6. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Turn off the stove, add vinegar or lemon juice, garnish with coriander and serve.

                            <img src= "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/370/31854502553_51a9e1cea4_o_d.jpg" />


I don't know why bhindi (okra) is not as popular as other low-carb vegetables. It has only 4.3 g net carbs for 100 grams and it  truly is delicious! The only thing you have to remember is to cook it properly to get rid of the slimy texture inside, so beware of that! 

<ul>
  <li>2,5 cups of bhindi/okra (250 g)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil: I use 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> and 1 tbsp mustard oil</li>
  <li>Salt (about 1/2 tsp in total)</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium onion)</li>
  <li>100 g fresh tomato (1/2 medium)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 dried red chili, or one green chili (if using fresh: chop and add with the garlic and ginger)</li>
  <li>Dried spices: 1/3 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp dried fenugreek leaves</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the coconut oil and use it to fry the chopped bhindi. This should take at least 15 minutes, until the slime disappears. It is a very important step, as otherwise you will end up with a slimy, gross curry!
  2. Take out the bhindi and keep for later. Add the rest of the oil (I used mustard oil) and add the cumin and dried red chilli. 
  3. When the cumin starts to pop, cook for about 30 seconds, then add the onion, garlic and ginger, with a bit of salt. Cook for 5-10 minutes until it is soft. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and spices (except the fenugreek leaves). Cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are broken down.
  5. Now put the bhindi back in the pan, add salt and 1/2 cup of water and cook covered on low heat for about 5-10 minutes. If there is too much liquid, cook it without the lid.
  6. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves and coriander, as well as some lemon juice (optional) and serve.

Cauliflower never disappoints me! I saw this recipe [here](http://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a48260/cauliflower-nachos-recipe/). It is very easy to make and very tasty. I added some protein powder to make it a full meal, but you can skip it and serve it as a side dish if you prefer. 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 big cauliflower (600g)</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>Salt, pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: garlic powder, chili, paprika</li>
  <li>1 cup (110g) shredded cheddar or edam</li>
  <li>1/2 avocado</li>
  <li>1/2 scoop protein powder, flavorless, such as <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Jalapenos in vinegar (about 20 g)</li>
  <li>35 g onion</li>
  <li>100 g fresh tomato</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oven to 220C.
  2. Chop the cauliflower into “steaks” about 1.5 cm thick each. I prefer to discard the edges as they break apart easily, so I keep them for cauli-rice.
  3. Put the cauliflower in a baking tray with salt, oil, pepper and spices to taste. Mix well, arrange in a single layer.
  4. Bake the cauliflower for 30-40 minutes until it is golden.
  5. Meanwhile, prepare the guacamole (mix the avocado, protein, lemon, 15 g onion, cilantro, salt and pepper) and the salsa (chop and mix the tomato, the rest of the onion, salt, pepper and some coriander).
  6. Once the cauliflower is golden, take out of the oven, cover with cheese and bake further 2 minutes so it melts.
  7. Take out of the oven, pour the salsa, guacamole and some jalapenos on top, and eat while it is still hot.

It is no news that i love indian food. One of my favorite things about it is roti and naan - so of course i suffer their loss when i do keto. I have struggled to find good egg-free recipes for keto bread; my recipe for [coconut roti](http://maria.recipes/coconutRoti) is delicious but coconut flour is quite expensive. So - here comes flax roti to the rescue! These are only 1 g net carb per roti (!!!), they are super soft, they actually puff up a little bit when cooking them like real roti do, and they can be stuffed to make parathas (recipe coming soon). Also, you can make a big batch and freeze them individually. Awesome :D 

<ul>
  <li>1 cup (150g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>2.5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>(20 g)</li>
  <li>1/2-3/4 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
  <li>Spices to taste; I like 1/4 tsp garlic and 1/4 tsp onion</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>About 2 tsp olive oil to cook</li>
  <li>Optional: about 3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> for rolling</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients.
  2. Add boiling water (start with 3/4 cup of water and add more depending on how much is needed). Knead it a little with your hands to make sure it is even. You should have a very sticky but quite firm dough.
  3. Divide the dough into five. Make a disk with each piece; if they dry up, wet them so it is easier to make the disk.
  4. For forming them, you can either use coconut flour and form as you would a normal roti (i used a chakla) or you can put it between plastic wrap and use a rolling pin or press them down into a thin disk of about 2 mm thick.
  5. Cook over medium-high heat on a lightly greased pan or tawa for about 2 minutes per side.

A very simple side dish suitable for all types of diet. It is a traditional style of cooking in spain, often made with cabbage with pieces of potatoes, or with cauliflower.


<ul>
  <li>1/4 big head of cabbage, shredded, or 320 g cabbage</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 to 1/3 tsp paprika (I like spicy paprika)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring 1.5 liters of water to the boil. Add the shredded cabbage and cok for 3-5 minutes depending on how cooked you like your vegetables. 
  2. While it boils, fry the garlic with the coconut oil.
  3. Once the cabbage is boiled, drain it, then add it to the golden garlic. Add the salt and some black pepper and cook for about 3 minutes. 
  4. Turn off the stove, add the olive oil and paprika, taste for seasoning, and serve.

This pizza base is seriously awesome. I used [this recipe](http://www.meatfreeketo.com/vegan-fathead-pizza-crust/) but omitted the vegan cheese and used some nutritional yeast instead to get some cheesy flavor. Seriously: this pizza holds its shape perfectly, is chewy and salty and delicious, vegan, and only 3.1 g net carbs for half a pizza crust!


<ul>
  <li>85 g of <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground (1/2 cup + 1.5 tbsp)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>(32 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp (6 g) nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water</li>
  <li>For Margharita Pizzaa: 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 cup (110 g) shredded mozzarella (you can use vegan mozzarella, but it will change the macros), 1/2 cup tomato passata, some dried oregano, fresh basil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  2. In a bowl, mix everything except the water. Then add the water little by little until you form a dough.
  3. Put the dough on a parchment paper, put another paper on top and then spread it out with a rolling pin until it is 2-3 mm thick. Once it is even, cut it out to whichever shape you want (I used a big lid to make it round). If it cracks, use your finger with a little bit of water to smooth it out. 
  4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until it's slightly dry and golden.
  5. Put whichever toppings you want and then bake for another 5-10 minutes.

When i got Maria Emmerich's book as a christmas present from my wonderful boyfriend I marked a zillion recipes on my to-do list. The broccoli cheese noodle soup was particularly wonderful, so I adapted it with a little less cheese, using zoodles instead of broccoli, and skipping the bacon, but you can top the soup with fried bacon bits instead of pumpkin seeds if you like pork.

<ul>
  <li>200 g zoodles (3 cups)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>1 tsp fresh garlic</li>
  <li>1/2 small onion (35 g)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cream cheese (60g)</li>
  <li>2/3 cup cheddar or edam cheese (75g)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 liter of broth (or 1/2 liter of water and one bouillon cube) + 1/2 liter of water</li>
  <li>Optional: 30 g pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt 1/3 tbsp butter in a pot. Add the zoodles and cook for about two minutes with a pinch of salt. Don't overcook them. 
  2. Take the zoodles out and save for later. Add in the rest of the butter and fry the onion and garlic bout 5 minutes until it is translucent (do not burnt like i did). 
  3. Add the cream cheese, mix well over low heat, then add the liquid, cheese and black pepper.
  4. Bring to a boil. Let it boil a couple of minutes, then blend with a hand blender.
  5. Add the zoodles back inside, bring up to temperature, serve and top with the pumpkin seeds.

This is the indian version of scrambled tofu: crumbled paneer with vegetables and spices. A very filling meal full of protein that takes 10 minutes from start to finish. A must try!

<ul>
  <li>250 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium), chopped</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (100g), chopped</li>
  <li>Other vegetables to taste (like green peas), optional</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/4 tsp whole cumin</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp garam masala or more to taste</li> 
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>  
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, if the crumbled paneer is too dry, add a little bit of warm water to rehydrate it.
  2. Melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds until they start popping. Then, add the onion with some salt and cook for 5 minutes until they are brown.
  3. Once the onion is cooked, add the ginger and garlic. Cook for a minute. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and salt. Cook for two minutes until they the tomatoes are soft, then add the other spices. Mix well. 
  5. Add the paneer (drained if you were soaking it). Cook for 30-60 seconds. Add the kasuri methi if you are using it.
  6. Garnish with lemon juice and coriander.

Parsley, garlic and olive oil are a classic combination in spanish cuisine, and they are often combined in a green sauce that is used for vegetables or fish. 

This is an easy side dish for a weeknight dinner or for serving up to your guests. 

<ul>
  <li>200 g white button mushrooms, only caps</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 small clove of garlic</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste (optional)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley: a handful (about 1/4 cup)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Blend the olive oil, garlic, spices, lemon juice, vinegar and parsley (traditionally, a morter and pestle should be used).
  2. Put the mushrooms over medium-low on a lightly greased pan. Cover with a lid and cook for about 10 minutes turning them halfway through, until they are soft. 
  3. Take them out, sprinkle with a bit of salt and fill them with a bit of the green sauce.

I love sautéed tofu; it gets very chewy and crunchy, and when mixed with spices it can be delicious.

<ul>
  <li>2 cups (250 g) firm tofu, cubed OR 200 g paneer (if using paneer, omit mayonnaise)</li>

  <li>1 cup of fresh cucumber (130g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup of fresh red bell pepper (75g) <i>(Optional; omit for fewer carbs)</i></li>  
  <li>1/2 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise OR 3/4 extra tbsp coconut oil and 3/4 extra tbsp olive oil</li>

* **Process**
  1. In a non-stick pan, melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Then add the tofu and all the spices along with 1/2 tbsp lemon juice. Sautée for 15-20 minutes until it is very golden and firm.
  2. Mix all the other ingredients and serve while the tofu is still warm. If you are making this ahead of time, keep the tofu in a separate container and warm up before eating.

Paneer is indian cottage cheese, one of the basic protein sources for vegetarian curries. You can use it in blocks in tikka or gravies, or you can crumble it for egg-free hash browns or bhurji. 

The nutritional info may not be 100% accurate as I estimated using packaged paneer. The more it is drained, the lower carb it will be.

<ul>
  <li>2 L (8 cups) whole fat milk</li>
  <li>1/4 cup lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy bottom saucepan.
  2. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice, stirring constantly until it curdles and the whey has separated completely.
  3. Using a very fine sieve or a cheese cloth, separate the curds from the whey. You can keep the whey for something different (it has some protein, but also carbs, so not keto-friendly!). 
  4. Drain the curd well and use it fresh, or put it with some weight on top to form a firm block.

Easiest recipe for a delicious Chicken Curry. It won't be as good as the recipes that use real indian spices and blends... but it is pretty darn good anyway :) 

<ul>
  <li>8 chicken drumsticks, with skin and bone (1 kg)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1/2 big onion or one medium (110g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or one big clove of garlic</li>
  <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
  <li>1 cup of coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/4-1 cup of water depending on desired sauce</li>
  <li><i>Optional:coriander to garnish</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. In a pot or a pressure cooker, in two batches, sear the meat (with some salt) for about 3 minutes, using 1 tbsp oil per batch. Set the seared drumsticks aside. 
  2. Purée the onion, ginger and garlic. 
  3. Heat up the other 2 tbsp oil and fry the onion paste, with salt and pepper, over medium heat for about 10 minutes until it smells sweet. 
  4. Add the curry powder. Cook for 60 seconds, then add the coconut milk and water (add water depending on how thick you want your sauce; add more water if you will be cooking on an open pot). Mix well until the sauce is even. 
  5. When it comes to a boil, add the chicken back in. Now cook on an open flame on low heat for about 45-60 minutes or in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes until the meat is tender. 
  6. Garnish with coriander and serve.

These are such a fun way to get more veggies in. Even my broccoli-hating family loved these!


<ul>
  <li>250 g broccoli</li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese (45 g)</li>
  <li>2 heaping tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> (24g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>A good pinch of salt and some black pepper</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of water (or more if needed)</li>
  <li><i>Optional: 1/2 serving of neutral flavor protein powder (equals 15 g protein)</i></li>
  <li><i>Optional, for frosting: 4 tbsp butter, 6 tbsp cream cheese (180g)</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. Steam the broccoli just until it is tender (don't overcook so it doesn't lose the bright green color). You can do this in the microwave. 
  2. Purée the broccoli. 
  3. Add all the other ingredients except for the ones for the frosting. 
  4. Divide into 9 muffin molds. 
  5. Cook in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes, OR microwave for 4 minutes, or until the center has set. 
  6. _Optional: whip the butter and cream cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper until you form a buttercream; use it to frost the muffins._

This soup takes about 20 minutes to put together, is loaded with protein and healthy fats, and amazingly tasty! 

If you are in a hurry you can cut the cooking time of the tofu and the onions by half, but I really love how the tofu gets a little bit crunchy on the outside. 

<ul>
  <li>250 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>One small red onion (70g), coarsly chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste or 1/2 inch ginger chopped</li>
  <li>1 medium zucchini (200g) spiralized or two broccoli stalks (about 140g) spiralized (omit for fewer carbs)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste or one big garlic clove chopped</li>
  <li>100 g mushrooms, sliced</li>
  <li>2/3 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
  <li>One bouillon cube</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick pot, put half the oil and add the onion, garlic and ginger. Cook ovver medium-low heat with a pinch of salt for about 15-20 minutes. 
  2. At the same time, in a non stick pan, add the other half of the oil, then cook the cubed tofu over high heat until it is very brown and dry, about 15 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, cook for about 5 minutes. Lastly, add the spiralized zucchini and cook for a minute.
  3. Once the onion is very soft, add the curry powder, coconut milk, water, chili and bouillon cube. Bring to a boil, then use blend with a hand mixer. 
  4. Add the tofu, mushrooms and zoodles. Let it all boil together for 1-2 minutes.
  5. Serve with coriander.

If you miss eating fajitas, or having curry with chapati... this recipe is for you! You will get really soft tortillas/chapati, with a light coconut flavour, that pairs well both with meats and veggies :) 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a></li>
  <li>2 tbsp (16 g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a></li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt (omit if using stock)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water or stock</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60g) butter or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>Optional: spices to taste (I like to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder)</li>
  <li>5 tsp oil, for cooking</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the butter or coconut oil. Mix separately the <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a>, spices and salt, then incorporate the butter.
  2. Add the water or stock, hot (almost boiling). Incorporate and mix until you have a sticky dough.  
  3. Now you have to act fast or else the dough will dry out: divide it into four balls. Knead each one a bit, then put in between two pieces of plastic wrap, and form a disk using a rolling pin or flattening it with a tray; it should be 2-3 mm thick. Then take something round (like the lid of a pan) and use it to cut the roti.
  4. Proceed this way for four tortillas. For the fifth one, use the remaining pieces you cut out of the others. If you prefer, you can just divide the dough in five and make 5 roti from the beginning, without cutting them out (although they won't be as round).
  5. Put a teaspoon of oil in a pan over high heat. Fry the roti about 2 minutes per side until golden.
  6. Keep in a cloth so they remain soft until you eat them, or let them cool down and freeze individually, separated by some parchment paper.

This recipe for burger patties using mung beans is a great way to get some legumes in your diet. Mung beans (green soy) have a very nice flavor, and if you let them sprout, the carb count will be lower and they will have more protein. On top of that, you can add any spices you want to get different styles.  

It is hard to know the exact nutritional information for this recipe as it depends on how long the beans sprout for; I estimated the data sprouting them for 3 or 4 days.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (100g) mung beans (green soy)</li>
  <li>Optional: 30 g unflavored protein powder (such as <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAykTb">whey</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ossGXa">pea protein powder</a>)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> or butter or ghee</li>
  <li>Other spices to taste</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Let the beans sprout for 3 or 4 days until they have roots of 1-2 cm. 
  2. Blend all the ingredients until you have a thick paste. 
  3. Divide into four and form patties using your hands.  
  4. Fry each patty with 1/2 tbsp oil until it is golden on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).

A great recipe for all those vegan ketoers, or anyone who cannot eat eggs but still wants to eat some french amazingness. You can adapt this basic recipe to your taste, changing the vegetables and/or adding other ingredients, such as cheese or meat! 


<ul>
  <li> 1 <a href="http://maria.recipes/ketoCrust">low-carb crust</a> </li>
  <li> 1.5 cups of chopped zucchini (180-200 g, one medium) </li>
  <li> One leek (80g) </li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li> 400 g firm tofu</li>
  <li> 3-4 tbsp water</li>
  <li> 1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li> Black pepper to taste</li>
  <li> <i>Optional: 3 tbsp nutritional yeast</i> </li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
  2. Use the oil to fry your vegetables. 
    - _I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to my vegetables to get some umami, as I didn't have nutritional yeast!_
  3. Blend the tofu with the water, turmeric, salt and pepper. You should get a dense batter.
  4. Add the cooked vegetables to the tofu mixture, then spoon over your crust.
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is set. Let it cool for 5 minutes before cutting into it.

This crust, based on the recipe from [healthfulpursuit](http://www.healthfulpursuit.com), takes a while to make, but is gluten-free, egg-free, vegan, low carb, and has a great flavor! 


<ul>
  <li>1 + 1/4 cups ground <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a></li>
  <li>1/4 sunflower seeds, ground</li>
  <li>80-100 g onion (one small)</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>Other ingredients to taste, for example one clove of garlic (minced)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oven to 110C.
  2. Blend the onion with the oil and vinegar. 
  3. In a separate bowl mix the other ingredients, then add the onion mixture. You should get a thick paste, dry but not crumbly. If it crumbles, add some water.
  4. Grease your quiche mold very well (or even better, put a circle of parchment paper in the bottom) and put the mixture inside. Then use a spoon or your hands to form the crust. Water your hands to smooth it out.
  5. Bake for 90 minutes until it is dry and crunchy. Then, take it out and add the filling of choice,

A great, easy, tasty, keto recipe. My family adores it, it literally takes 10-15 minutes to make, and is super filling. You have to try it!

Add more oil if you want it to be more filling, or accompany with a fatty vegetable side dish.


<ul>
  <li> 2 salmon fillets, about 1 inch thick (14 oz in total)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li> The green part of 3 leeks (cut out the ends) OR one whole leek (90g)</li>
  <li> 1 tsp fresh ginger paste</li>
  <li> 1/4 tsp salt</li>  
  <li> 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li> 3 tbsp water</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li> Stevia or sweetener to taste (equals 1-2 tsp sugar)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
  <li> Optional: coriander for garnishing</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the coconut oil over high heat. Then fry the ginger for 2 minutes.
  2. Add the leeks, salt and pepper. Cook stirring frequently for about 5 minutes, until soft.
  3. Add the salmon and cook on high for 2 minutes on each side.
  4. Add the soy sauce and water, cook for 30 seconds, then cover and reduce to low heat until the salmon is cooked through.
  5. Once cooked, add the lemon juice, stevia and sesame oil, mix well and serve.

It had been so long since I published any indian food! This is one of my favorite veg curries. It is sweet with a slightly acid touch thanks to the mango powder (that can be substituted for lemon), and is awesome with some dal and rice or roti.


<ul>
  <li>500 g pumpkin or butternut squash</li>
  <li>Dried red chili (1-2)</li>
  <li>100 g onion</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida (can be subbed for 1/2 tsp garlic paste, that would be used with the ginger)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, to serve</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil (mustard or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or 1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Stevia or sweetener to taste (equivalent to 1 tsp sugar)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil. Fry the fenugreek seeds, chili and asafoetida for 2 minutes (don't burn them!!!).
  2. Add the ginger. Cook for 1 minute, then add the onion and salt. Cook on slow heat for about 10 minutes, until it is brown and soft. 
  3. Add the pumpkin and spices (except amchoor) and some more salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Then, pour 1/4 cup water and cover.
  4. Cook on low heat. Once the pumpkin is soft, add the rest of the ingredients, mix and serve.

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/403/31699704665_590bb3e042_o_d.jpg" />

This is an indian appetizer from the region of Gujarat: vegan savory pancakes made with moong lentils, and filled with anything you like. They can be had plain with chutney, or filled with paneer (like I did), tomato onion and coriander, or whatever you fancy. 
They are usually had with tea in the afternoon, but I like them as a lunch or dinner appetizer: they are light, full of protein and everybody likes them, even the biggest of carnivores!


<ul>
  <li>1/2 moong dal, preferibly peeled (100 g)</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp asafoetida (you can substitute it with 1/2 clove of garlic, smashed into a paste)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt </li>
  <li>Chilli to taste (preferibly green chili paste)</li>
  <li>A few drops of stevia (equivalent to 2 tsp sugar)</li>
  <li>50 g paneer (or cottage cheese)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp Chaat masala (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp fresh coriander</li>
  <li>2 tsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> (for cooking)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Wash the lentils properly, then soak them for 3-4 hours. 
  2. Drain, add 3 tbsp water and grind into a fine paste. If necessary you can add more water. You should end up with a pancake-like batter. 
  3. Add the salt, baking soda, asafoetida and stevia and mix well. 
  4. Lightly grease a pan or tawa (with 1/2 tsp oil per chilla it is usually enough) and put it over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 of the batter and use a spatula to make a thin disk of about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Put the filling on top while it cooks; in this case, paneer, coriander and a bit of chaat masala. 
  6. When the batter starts to dry in the top (about 2-3 minutes), flip it, cook another minute, flip again and fold it in half to keep the filling inside. Proceed with the other chilla. 
  7. Serve them with more paneer, coriander, chaat masala, tomato and onion, or with your favorite chutney.

This is one of these recipes that I make in bulk and then freeze for an easy lunch or dinner for another day. These sausages are fenomenal, very high protein and quite low-carb, so they make for a great dinner when combined with some cauli-rice, keto bbq sauce and salad. Hope you enjoy them!

This is my go-to keto breakfast with some coconut milk or greek yogurt, and it is also great when I am travelling (I just ask for some whole-fat yogurt and add my granola right there!). It is more of a guideline to make your own keto-fied granola, a low carb and extra crunchy cereal that you can customize to your own taste. 


<ul>
  <li>3/4 cup (105 g) <a href="http://amzn.to/2otU1I8">hemp hearts</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2otVtKC">hemp seeds</a></li>

  4. Let it set in the fridge. Then, take out and break it into smaller chunks. 
  5. Keep in the fridge until consumed. It lasts up to 2 weeks.

A very handy recipe for any low-carb vegetarians or vegans out there: 10 g protein and only 5.5 g of net carbs per pattie. And they can be frozen raw, to thaw and use for a quick simple meal!
(Warning: do not sprout the soy beans for this recipe. They develop a very weird taste!). 
You can change the spices according to your taste, to make different flavored burgers.

<ul>
    <li>150 g soy beans</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil (you can use less if you prefer)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 flax "eggs": 3 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground + 6 tbsp warm water</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tsp liquid smoke</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Soak the beans for 12 hours.
  2. Boil the beans for about 45 minutes, or until they are softer but still have texture (if they get too mushy, the burgers won't hold)
  3. Prepare the flax eggs and let them rest 5 minutes.
  4. Process the beans until you get a couscous texture. Then, mix with the rest of ingredients to form a dense mixture. 
  5. Divide into 6 and form the patties with your hands.
  6. Cook with a teaspoon of olive oil over medium-high heat, about 2-3 minutes per side.

It is so difficult to make vegan keto pancakes!! Coconut flour gets really funky when not mixed with eggs... I always ended up having a blobby slimy mess! 

I decided to adapt my previos keto pancake recipe, increasing the oil to get a more consistent batter that wouldn't end up making crepes rather than pancakes, and using a flax egg (remember to let it rest 5 minutes before using it!). I like to use vanilla protein powder: depending on the brand, you might have to adjust the liquid (add a bit less to the flax egg), and if you use unflavored protein, you might want to add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and stevia to taste.

These are not super fluffy, but they require very few ingredients, they are easy to make and they make an awesome breakfast when topped with a piece of my [keto chocolate](http://maria.recipes/ketoChocolate)!

<ul>
  <li>1 flax egg: 1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground + 3 tbsp water</li>
  <li>1.5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>1/2 scoop of vanilla flavor vegan Powder (<a href="http://amzn.to/2nRfHwC">whey</a> or a vegan powder) (2 tbsp)</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the flax, protein powder, salt and baking powder. 
  2. In a separate bowl, mix the flax egg with the oil.
  3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix well. You should end up with a dense mixture.
  4. Heat up a lightly greased non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot, divide the pancake mixture into three and pour. You will need a slightly wet spoon to smooth out the pancakes so they are about 1/2 cm thick.
  5. Cook 5 minutes on the first side until, then flip over and cook 2 more minutes.

I am so happy about this lasagna! It is vegetarian (and can be vegan if you use a vegan milk and omit the mozzarella) and low-carb, and it is as good as the traditional one!

For the sauce, you can combine milk and heavy cream as you want, and/or use vegetarian milks to lower the carb count. In my case, i used soy milk mixed with single cream.


<ul>
    <li>2 medium zucchini (400 g)</li>
    <li>2/3 chopped onion (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>50 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a> ground</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2otIMQ1">psyllium husk powder</a></li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li> 
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini in thin strips of about 2 mm thick. Then cook with a little bit of olive oil on a non-stick pan, in the microwave or steam them, until they are slightly softer but not completely mushy!  
  2. Hydrate the soy in salty water or in stock.
  3. Fry the onion on medium heat about 10 minutes until it is soft. After, add the rest of ingredients and 1/2 cup of water and let everything boil until you have a nice thick sauce.
  4. For the white sauce: warm up the water and cream with the nutmeg and some salt. Then add the psyllium and mix very well (you might need a hand mixer). Adjust the texture bu adding more psyllium or more milk. 
  5. Make the lasagna alternating layers of zucchini and soy mixture, and use the bechamel to cover everything. Then add the mozzarella on top.  
  6. Bake at 180-200C for 30 minutes, putting it under the broiler in the last 5 min.

This is not really a new recipe; I just adapted my [previous cabbage roll recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRollso) to decrease the carbs, filling them with soy granules and seeds. They are as good as the original recipe, and this time I made a video on how to make the wraps. I hope you like them. 



<ul>
    <li>One whole cabbage head (we will use the 8 outer leaves, about 260 g)</li>
    <li>70 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds (65g), chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1/2 onion (80g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Spices: 1 tsp spicy paprika,</li> 
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li> 
    <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li> 
    <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li> 
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups of tomato purée (passata)</li> 
    <li>6 cloves</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>A pinch of salt</li> 
    <li>Some sugar or stevia (optional)</li> 
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. First, boil the whole cabbage. I made it in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes. Then, cool with water to stop any further cooking. 
  2. Hydrate the soy granules. Meanwhile, gently fry the onion with 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and bay leaf.
    * If you want the onion to be extra soft and sweet, you can make it like I did  [in my other recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRolls)
  3. Once the onion is soft, add the spices and cook for a minute. Then, add the soy, seeds and tomato paste. Cook for 5 more minutes and then let it cool. You can add fresh parsley or coriander if you like it.
  4. Take the 8 outer cabbage leaves. Put them flat over a surface and, with a knife, trim the stem without cutting all the way through.
  5. Divide the soy mixture into eight, and put a portion onto each cabbage leaf. Then, wrap like I show in the video. 
  6. Put the rolls in a big pot in one or two layers, leaving little space between them. Mix the ingredients for the sauce (all the other ingredients) and pour over the rolls. 
  7. Let them boil for about 30 minutes.
  8. Serve with flax bread, rice, salad...

This is an easy week-night dinner that my mom would make quite often when I was a kid. It was one of the few vegetable dishes that I actually enjoyed! 

I tweaked it a little bit to make it lower carb and higher in fat, and the result is delicious :D 


<ul>
    <li>One big eggplant (550-600g)</li>
    <li>50 g of tuna (canned in brine)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (40 g) parmesan</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch of chili to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, cut the eggplant lenthgwise and cook it until it is tender: you can cook it in the microwave, in the oven or in a pan.
  2. Once cooked through, use a spoon to scoop out the flesh of the eggplant, leaving the skin and part of the flesh to stuff later.
  3. In a bowl, chop the eggplant flesh finely, and then add all the other ingredients (leave some of the parmesan to use as topping) and mix.
  4. Use the mixture to fill in the eggplant skins. Top with more cheese.
  5. Warm up for the filling to set, either in the microwave or in the oven.

I love this curry and its aromatic, thick sauce. It's a real crowd-pleaser. The traditional way of making it takes forever, but I used [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1qXKTbqOM) as reference, since it is easier and takes "only" one hour to make. 

For the sauce you can use cashews, which make it creamier, but I used almonds to lower the carbs in the recipe.

Eat it with rice, naan or, in my case, salad and cauli-rice :D 


<ul>
  <li>325 g white onion</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2 cm ginger or 1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp oil (I used mustard oil)</li>
  <li>420 g chicken breast (you could use drumsticks instead; it will be even better!)</li>
  <li>30 whole, peeled almonds (40-45g), soaked in water for 24h</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut milk</li>
  <li>3/4 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>5 cm cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>10 cloves</li>
  <li>10 green cardamom</li>
  <li>3 tsp powdered coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1-1.5 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: some sugar or stevia, if you want the sauce to be sweet.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, blend the ingredients for the onion purée until smooth: onions, garlic, ginger. Separately, form the almond paste, blending the almonds, 3 tbsp coconut milk and 3 tbsp water.
  2. In a pan, heat up the oil and fry the whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick) 2 minutes, without burning them. 
  3. Add the onion purée and a bit of salt and cook, stirring often, for about 15 minutes on medium-high. Be careful not to let it stick to the bottom of the pan. 
  4. Meanwhile, cube the chicken (if using drumsticks, leave them whole) and blend the ingredients for the almond paste.
  5. Once the onion has formed a pretty dry paste, take off the stove and add the ground spices. Cook for about a minute. Then, add in the chicken with some salt and brown for 5 minutes.
  6. Pour the coconut milk and 3/4 cup of water and mix well to form a thick sauce. Lower the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Add more water if it starts to get dry.  
  7. Finally, add the almond paste and the garam masala and mix. Add more water if you want a thinner sauce. Let everything boil for a couple of minutes and serve.

These are the cutest little fat bombs I have made! They have an almond-butter crust and a creamy lemon filling, full of coconut oil goodness! They are also gluten-free and can be adapted for a dairy-free version, as well!

If you want to have a third layer, add a tablespoon of lemon or strawberry gellatin on top. That would be even lovelier!


<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup almond meal (I used crushed roasted almonds)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>A pinch of stevia or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nR8cWo">erythritol</a> (to taste; I used about 1/2 tsp of truvia)</li>
    <li>25 g melted butter or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>5 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a>, melted</li>
    <li>The zest of one lemon</li>
    <li>60 g cream cheese (substitute for coconut cream for dairy-free)</li>
    <li>1-2 tbsp lemon juice (to taste)</li>
    <li>Stevia or <a href="http://amzn.to/2nR8cWo">erythritol</a>, to taste (I used 1 tbsp truvia)</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients for the crust: almonds, flax, salt, pinch of stevia. Then add the butter and mix until you have a dough that doesn't crumble. If necessary, add some more butter.
  2. Blend all the ingredients for the cream: coconut oil, zest, cream cheese, lemon juice, sweetener and vanilla extract.
  3. Using small molds (I used ice cream cubes), put a layer of the base and then a layer of the cream on top. I made 16 small fat bombs. 
  5. Let it harden in the fridge (1-2 hours), then take out of the mold. Keep in the fridge until consumed. They will last 4-5 days in the fridge in an air-tight container.

These pancakes are my new favorite! They are so thick and fluffy, are fast to make in the morning, and so delicious! I hope you enjoy them as much as me! 


<ul>
  <li>10 g of <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRfHwC">vanilla flavored</a> protein powder (1/3 of a serving)</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
  <li>2/3 tbsp of <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> or butter + 1/3 for cooking</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp vinegar</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp baking soda</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the coconut oil or butter. Then mix with the egg and vinegar. 
  2. In a different bowl, mix all the dry ingredients.
  3. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ones and mix.
    - _If I make it ahead of time, I mix everything except the baking soda, and then mix it in thoroughly right before cooking._
  4. Heat up a non-stick pan with oil or butter on medium-high heat. Once hot, add the batter and cook like regular pancakes: about 1-1.5 minutes on the first side until you have bubbles on the surface, then flip and cook another minute on the other side. 
  5. Serve with your favorite low-carb topping - in my case, low-carb blackberry jam <3

This is an italian dish perfect for carnivores, but it also works wonderfully using seitan instead of chicken (_but if you are using seitan, the final carb count will be higher_. The final result is a slightly thick sauce, acidic from the lemon and capers, and with smooth buttery texture... Perfect with salad, rice or cauli-rice! 

If you follow a ketogenic diet, do not hesitate on adding more butter - the more, the better :D 

<ul>
  <li>750 g chicken breast fillets, or 6 seitan steaks</li>
  <li>1/3 medium onion (60g), sliced finely</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>2 tbsp capers</li>
  <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
  <li>One chicken stock cube (optional)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (125 mL) white wine</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60 mL) lemon juice</li>
  <li>The zest of half a lemon</li>
  <li>About 1/4 cup of chopped parsley</li>
  <li>1 tbsp flax meal</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, brown the chicken (with some salt) using a bit of the butter over medium-high. Leave the browned pieces on the side for later. 
  2. Add the rest of butter and oil in the pan and fry the onion and garlic over medium-low for 10-15 minutes, until it's brown and soft. 
  3. Add the meat back in and pour the wine. Let it simmer about 5 minutes for the alcohol to evaporate. Mix well.
  4. After, add the capers, some black pepper and half the parsley. Mix well. 
  5. Finally, add the flax (to thicken the sauce) and the lemon juice. Turn off the stove and garnish with the rest of the parsley and some lemon slices.

I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I try to bake sugar-free and no carb goods these days. And while experimenting, sometimes things work out :)

I love this recipe because it is easy, tasty, and it can be made in the microwave (I hate turning on the oven in summer!). It makes for quite fudgy and chocolate-y brownies, very low-carb, as well as dairy and gluten-free. And I love the crunch from the walnuts :) 

For vegans or those who don't eat eggs, you can probably use a flax egg instead (1 tbsp flax meal with 2 tbsp of water) and add some psyllium husk powder (otherwise, the coconut flour with the flax might not form a proper batter).

The final flavor might change slightly depending on the protein powder you use, but if you like how your protein powder tastes, you will love these!


<ul>
  <li>30 g <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a> (1/4 cup)</li>
  <li>45 g of your favorite <a href="http://amzn.to/2osnH91">chocolate flavored protein powder</a></li>
  <li>15 g cocoa powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp of coffee granules, or cinnamon</li>
  <li>Optional: stevia or erythritol; I recommend trying the batter and adjusting to taste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a> (you can use butter instead)</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>Vanilla extract</li>
  <li>30 g chopped walnuts (optional, but... why wouldn't you use them!?)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup of water (to start with; you will have to add more later)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl (first 7 ingredients) and the wet ingredients in a different one (all the others). Leave the walnuts on the side for now.
  2. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix. Then, add water little by little to adjust the texture, until you get a batter similar to the one for a spongecake. You will probably need 1/2 extra cup of water.
  3. Add the chopped walnuts into your batter and mix.
  4. Pour the batter into a greased baking mold.
  5. Bake at 180C for 25 minutes or in the microwave at 800W for about 4 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. The microwave cooking time varies a lot from one microwave to another, so keep a close eye on it to avoid overcooking and ending up with hard, dry brownies.

Another low-carb recipe that doesn't require many ingredients and is great for when you buy zucchini in bulk (like me!). 

These are soft, slightly sweet tortillas, that are great freshly made to make fajitas, tacos or quesadillas, and they hold pretty good in the fridge for 2-3 days - just heat them up for a few seconds and use!


<ul>
  <li>500 g zucchini, grated (2,5 medium zucchini)</li>
  <li>3 tbsp (heaping) <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNLHjD">coconut flour</a></li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp pesto (optional, you can add more or omit)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: shredded cheese</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Turn on the oven to 180C to preheat.
  2. Squeeze that grated zucchini, and then squeeze some more. You should end up with about 1 cup of zucchini. You can keep the liquid for cooking instead of water.
  3. Mix all the ingredients until you form a paste.
  4. Divide it into six balls, then put them onto a non-stick tray or parchment paper. Using your hands, shape them into tortilllas, about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are slightly dry, but are still soft. 
  6. Optional: if you want to make hard taco shells, put the tortillas hanging on the wire rack of the oven and cook them on low heat so they get dry and crispy.

This is super tasty for taco night, but will work for any recipe in which you want to substitute minced meat - just adapt the spices to the recipe you are using! 

If you are using it for mexican food - I would recommend adding some minced vegan chorizo for a more intense flavor. A recipe will be coming up soon!


<ul>
  <li> 50 g small soy granules</li>
  <li> 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
  <li> 1 cup vegetable stock</li>
  <li> 1/2 small red onion (30 g)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> Optional: fresh coriander, to garnish</li>
</ul>



* **Process**
  1. Chop the pumpkin seeds roughly. Put the soy and the seeds in a bowl with the soy sauce and the stock for at least 10-15 minutes to hidrate.
  2. Heat up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Fry on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes until it looks soft.
  3. Add the spices and the tomato purée. Mix and cook for about 1 minute.
  4. Add the soy-seed mixture with its liquid and cook for a few minutes until it warms up. You can add more liquid if you want, or dry it out more to your liking.
  5. Turn off the stove, add the lemon juice and coriander and eat!

An easy way to make your own protein bars, low on carbs, vegan, and only four ingredients. 

This is my version, where I am using sunbutter, but according to the [original recipe](http://meatfreeketo.com/homemade-keto-protein-bar-formula/), any type of nut or seed butter will work, and you can change the proportions to your liking.

<ul>
    <li>6 tbsp cream cheese</li>
    <li>6 tbsp sunbutter, or nut/seed butter of choice</li>
    <li>80 g protein powder (I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2osnH91">chocolate flavored whey</a>)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix everything except the oil with patience. If it is dry, add the oil a bit at a time; i needed 2 tbsp. You should end up with a firm dough, similar to play-doh.
  2. Let it cool down in the fridge.
  3. Cut in 6 equal pieces.

This is a very easy dish with few ingredients, full of fiber, very healthy, and keto-friendly.

I don't eat meat so I'm using seitan that I minced, but for omnivores, you could use ground meat (preferably a very fatty one, which would make this higher in fat).

<ul>
    <li>1/2 medium cabbage, thinly sliced (400g)</li>
    <li>1/6 red onion (30 g), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>80 g seitan minced, OR minced meat</li>
    <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>1/2 or 1 whole garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce + 1/4 tsp kelp powder (optional) OR 1 tbsp soy sauce + 2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp tahini paste or peanut butter</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>Sweetener of choice - I used stevia</li>
    <li>To serve: lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, fry the ginger and garlic on the oil for 30 seconds.
  2. Add the cabbage and onion. Cook covered on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the soy sauce, kelp, tahini, black pepper and chili powder.
  3. When it starts to soften, add the seitan (or meat)and mix. Cook for another 2 minutes. 
  4. Then,add the sauce, mix and cook for a couple of minutes. 
  5. When the cabbage is soft, add the eggs as shown in the video: add them raw and mix fast, so they cook covering the cabbage to make it moist.

This sauce is THE BOMB. Low-carb. Keto. Vegan. Delicious. 

I just had it with shredded seitan over some salad. Yum! <3

<ul>
    <li>1/3 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://amzn.to/2nRguh4">coconut oil</a></li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 can of tomato sauce (425 g)</li>
    <li>3 tsp liquid smoke</li>
    <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp smoked spicy paprika</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    <li>Sweetener of choice - I used stevia to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a saucepan, warm up the oil and then fry the garlic and onion over low heat for about 10 minutes, until they are very soft.
  2. Take it off the heat and once it cools down a bit (otherwise it will make a mess), add all the ingredients. 
  3. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. 
  4. Once it is done simmering, check for salt and add sweetener to taste. 
  5. _Optional: blend the sauce for a smooth texture_

Super easy and incredibly delicious recipe. Can be vegan and gluten-free, and is full of fiber, flavor, healthy fats – and great for keto-ers! Just add some more fat to fit your macros, and use whatever vegetables you prefer. And if you wish to avoid tofu, you can use paneer (although this will increase the fat content of the recipe).

I like to at it with a big green salad and some keto bread. Makes for an awesome meal to pack for work!


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>600 g tofu OR 450 g paneer</li>
    <li>1/3 of a purple onion, thinly sliced (35 g)</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>100 g spinach, cooked (I use frozen spinach that I then cook in the microwave!)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of coconut milk (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp powdered cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp red chili powder (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 basil leaves optional</li>
    <li>Sugar to taste (I used stevia)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (or 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp fish sauce)</li>
    <li>Half a bunch of broccoli (250 g) (previously steamed, or use it raw and let it cook longer)</li>
    <li>Optional: 60 g of carrot (omit if keto)</li>
    <li>Optional: some fresh coriander</li>
    <li>To garnish: 40 g roasted or fried almonds or peanuts, chopped</li>
    <li>To garnish: lemon or lime</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Start by frying the onion, ginger and carrots over medium heat
  2. In a blender, blend the ingredients for the sauce: spinach, coconut milk, cumin, coriander, chili, black pepper, basil, stevia, soy sauce. Set aside for later. 
  3. Once the onions are very soft, add the tofu and cook over medium-high until it gets golden.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until they are tender (I used steamed broccoli so I only cooked it for 2 minutes so it would warm up). 
  5. Add the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. 
  6. Turn of the heat, sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve with some lemon or lime.

Since going keto two weeks ago I have been craving good indian food. Unfortunately, dal chawal (lentil curry with rice) is not really keto-friendly, so an egg curry with some salad and/or cauli-rice seemed like a good enough substitute!

This is more of a pattern to make a very easy egg curry. I usually just add more or less spices depending on how I am feeling that day, so feel free to change the amounts and/or add other spices or ingredients - maybe amchoor, some chunks of red bell pepper... Experiment!

<ul> 
    <li>18 boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    <li>400 g tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>300 g onions, chopped</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>An inch of ginger, chopped (or 1 tsp ginger paste)</li>
    <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 tbsp oil (I am using mustard oil)</li>
    <li>Optional: sugar or sweetener of choice</li> 
    <li>1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream (6-g) (you can sub for greek yogurt or coconut milk)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Heat the oil in a saucepan, then add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat until they are quite soft. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes for the raw smell to go away. 
  3. Add the spices and cook for 1 minute. If it's too dry and you are scared they will burn, add some water. 
  4. Add the tomatoes, salt and tomato paste. Cover and cook on low for about 10-15 minutes, until the tomatoes are very soft. 
  5. _Optional step: you can fry the peeled eggs for a couple of minutes with some oil; this gets them slightly crunchy outside._
  6. Once the tomatoes are soft, blend the sauce and add the yogurt and sugar. Add some water if the sauce is too thick.
  7. Put it back into the stove, add the eggs (whole or cut in half), let them boil together for a couple of minutes and serve with some fresh coriander.

Lately I have been experimenting with high-fat-low-carb cooking for my father, who is giving a go at the ketogenic diet. He has been doing pretty good, but was always complaining about not having bread to dip the sauce in... So I perfected an easy, microwave recipe for anybody in a similar situation in which they cannot eat bread: keto, paleo or gluten-free, you will like this! The flavor of flax is quite strong, but by using extra virgin olive oil, the final result tastes mostly like olive oil, and is very good with cheese, guacamole, egg, or even jam! 
Just remember - when it comes to flax meal, it´s best if you grind it at home, so it doesn´t lose nutrients :)

<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/288/31661818156_c5095f4e93_o_d.jpg" alt="BreadInside" style="width: 250px;"/>

<ul>
    <li>100 mL of <a href="http://amzn.to/2oA16Uv">flax seeds</a>, ground</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp water</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Blend the egg, oil and water until foamy. In a separate bowl, mix the flax meal, baking powder and salt.
  2. Incorporate the liquids into the flax mixture and mix well; let it rest for 5-10 min. It will look a bit runny in the beginning but the texture will thicken after it rests. 
  3. Divide into three separate molds; I use silicone muffin molds for this. You can sprinkle some sesame seeds on the top if you want.
  4. Microwave on high for 2 minutes or until it sets.

Chowmein is an indo-chinese dish, very typical from Nepal: streetfood served often in doubtious places, but delicious!  

Normally this would use whole-wheat noodles, but I decided to substitute them for spiralized vegetables. I am using turnips, but you could use other white vegetables. It also usually has carrot but I am avoiding it to keep it low-carb. 

The most popular ones are Veg Chowmein (vegetarian) and Chicken Chowmein (chicken), although other types of meat can be used, or shrimp or egg. I sometimes make it using tofu (to have some protein but keep it vegan), but whoever wants to can add the meat or shrimp along with the vegetables so they fry together. And of course, quantities are just to orientate you, and can be adapted!

This is a strong and tasty dish, spicy and slightly sweet, perfect for 3-4 people. I hope you like it.

<ul>
  <li>3 spiralized turnips, 360g (or you can substitute for whole-wheat noodles)</li>
  <li>1/4 cabbage (300g), thinly sliced (you can use the spiralizer for this!)</li>
  <li>1/2 red bell pepper (60g), cut in trips</li>
  <li>1 medium red onion (100g)</li>
  <li>Other optional vegetables, such as a handful of boiled green beans</li>
  <li>250 g firm tofu (optional)</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves very finely chopped or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>Strips of fresh ginger (that should be added with the other vegetables) or 2 tsp ginger paste (that would be added with the garlic)</li>
  <li>3 eggs (optional)</li>
  <li>Optional: spring onions, for garnishing</li>
  <li>4 tsp soy sauce (half could be substituted for oyster sauce, for non-vegetarian people)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp red chili paste or red chili powder (this should be adapted to taste; 1 tsp is very spicy)</li>
  <li>Salt. </li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tsp rice vinager, lime juice, or something similar</li>
  <li>3 tbsp of coconut oil</li>
  <li>To serve: ketchup and chili sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>

  1. In a big enough pan, over medium-high heat, put a tablespoon of oil and then fry the cubed tofu until golden, for about 5 minutes. Later, take it out and put aside for later. 
  2. Pour the rest of the oil in the pan and add the onion. Let them cook for 5 minutes. When they start to turn translucent, add the rest of the vegetables and cook until tender.
  3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes so it loses the raw flavor.
  4. Add the vegetable "noodles", mix well and then pour the sauce over everything.
  5. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the "noodles" are tender. Check for salt. 
  6. Serve with some kétchup and chili sauce on top.

In my family everybody loves "boquerones en vinagre", a typical spanish appetizer made of raw anchovies that are dipped in vinager until they change their texture, and then eaten with olive oil and garlic. However, I am not a big fan of raw fish, and since I am trying to base my eating in plants, I remembered I heard abuot vegans making "calabacín en vinagre", zucchini in vinager, so I thought I would give it a go. 

And yes, it was a great idea! The texture and flavor are perfect to eat as they are with some beer in summer, or in a light and fresh salad. 



<ul>  
  <li>Zucchini</li>
  <li>White vinager</li>
  <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Garlic</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini very thin using a potato peeler, to form thin strips. Add a little bit of salt.
  2. Put the zucchini in a deep dish, cover in vinager and let it rest in the vinager overnight (8 hours). 
   - _It's best not to leave it for too long; if left for 24 hours, it tastes too much like vinager!_
  3. Take it out from the meat and drain properly.
  4. Put the zucchini in layers in a plate and add the oil, chopped garlic and parsley.
  5. Leave it to rest for at least an hour. 
  6. It's done.

A good way of sneaking some vegetables inside of the pizza... It's very hard to tell the crust is made of cauliflower!

And it's a great way of having a low-carb, high-fiber dinner. 

Don't be skeptical and give it a try. It is delicious!

<ul>
  <li>1 big cauliflower or 5 cups (600g) of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a></li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan (70g)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Put the cauliflower rice in two batches in the microwave for 5 minutes. Afterwards, put all the cooked cauliflower into a clean teatowel, fold it and squeeze as much water as you can. If your arms are starting to hurt, you are doing it right. You should spend 5 or 10 minutes doing this, so the final result has good consistency.
  2. Once squeezed properly, mix all the ingredients and preheat your oven to 180C
  3. Poner la masa sobre un papel de horno en una bandeja de horno y darle forma con las manos. 
   - _The thickness depends on your taste, but it should be even. For pizza I make it 0.3 cm thick, but you can also make tortillas making it very thin, and later on use them for wraps._
  4. Bake until golden. It is a good idea to put it on the lower part of the oven for the last couple of minutes so that the base doesn't end up soggy.
  5. Take out of the oven, put the toppings you like, bake it for a couple more minutes so the cheese melts, and... _voilà!_

This is a dish that my bae and I love. He is usually not a big fan of vegetables, but when I make this, it disappears in no time! And I love it too not just because of the flavour, but because it takes very little time to make (the most annoying part is chopping the vegetables!).

The final result is very good, and combines wonderfully with some plain basmati rice. For those who want to, sometimes I like to add some pan-fried paneer or tofu to have some more protein in my meal. 

An easy and  yummy curry, it's worth trying!


<ul>
  <li>250 g sliced mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 medium brown onion (110g), finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 medium-sized tomato (140g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp powdered chili (or to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</li>
  <li>Lemon juice: 1 tbsp or to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh coriander to garnish</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, add the onion with a bit of salt and brown them for about 5 minutes. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and let them cook for 1-2 minutes, so they loose their "raw" flavour. 
  3. Turn down the heat and add the powdered spices and let them roast for about a minute to become more fragrant (if the pan is too dry and the spices might burn, add a bit of water). 
  4. Add the mushrooms with a bit of salt, mix, turn the heat to medium and cover. 
  5. Cook stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are almost cooked. 
  6. Add the tomato and the tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes until the tomato is broken down. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves crushing them between your fingers, add some lemon juice and serve. If you like, you can garnish with some coriander, too!

                        <div class="post-content">
                            <img src= "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/273/31698838425_d6a909cc53_o_d.jpg" />

One of my favourite vegetarian foods is palak paneer, a spinach and cheese curry. There is only one minor problem with it, and it is precisely one of its key ingredients: Paneer.

Don't get me wrong. I love it. But I cannot seem to be able to find it in stores, trying to replace it with other cheeses just leads to weird-looking attempts at the recipe, and making the paneer myself... well. has anyone tried to make paneer from scratch on a busy week?
Um... not very practical. 

So, the ultimate way to make palak paneer is to not make palak paneer at all, but to make palak TOFU. Yup, you read that right. Tofu actually has quite a neutral flavour that works very well with the spices of the dish, it holds its shape properly, gives nice texture and colour, and from a nutritional point of view, I quite prefer it to the paneer. 

I know this may sound strange, but seriously: my lovely indian boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, and he was so impressed that I had actually taken the time to make the paneer from scratch... it was only after several times of making it that I told him it was tofu! 


<ul>
  <li>300 g paneer or tofu (if using tofu: freeze and defreeze so it firms up)</li>
  <li>450 g frozen chopped spinach</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil (3 if using tofu)</li>
  <li>1/2 big onion,  finely chopped (75 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or 2 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 green chili, desseded and sliced</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>2 bay leafs or 1 big indian bay leaf</li> 
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp red chili powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp heavy whipping cream (4 tbsp if using tofu)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dry fenugreek leaves (you can leave it out and maybe add 1&2 tsp cinnamon and garnish with coriander, but the flavor will be very different)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cook the spinach according to the package instructions (I cook mine in the microwave). 
  2. In a pan, put some oil (1/2-1 tbsp) with the whole spices and the chili. Once they start warming up, add the garlic, ginger and onion, with a pinch of salt. 
  3. Brown in the pan for about 10 minutes until the onion is tender. Then, add the powdered spices and cook for one minute. 
  4. Add the spinach with some water and salt. Let cook for 5 minutes. 
  5. Add the tofu and let cook together for a couple of minutes. 
  6. Let it cook until the water has evaporated to the consistency of the gravy you like. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the yoghurt and the fenugreek leaves and serve.

                            <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/223/31661878936_43279a6a9b_k_d.jpg" />

Pho is an amazing vietnamese soup full of bright flavors. I made this version using spiralized celery root instead of noodles - and my boyfriend didn't even realise he was eating vegetables! 

I recommend using good quality stock for this. If you don't want to buy one, you can use the same recipe but add some good quality meat bones, and just let the broth simmer for a couple of hours with the spices, ginger and onion to make your own stock. 


<ul>  
  <li>1/2 celeriac (celery root) (125g)</li>
  <li>1 small brown onion, in 4 big pieces</li>
  <li>About 3 cm piece of ginger, sliced transversally</li>
  <li>Whole spices: half a cinnamon stick, 2 star anise, 1 tsp coriander seeds, 3 cloves, 1 black cardamom (Can be omitted if necessary)</li>
  <li>200 g beef (preferably sirloin), very finely cut across the grain. You could use raw meat, leftovers or chicken. <i>(In order to do this, I cut it when it is slightly frozen.)</i></li>
  <li>4 cups of good chicken or beef stock</li>
  <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>To garnish: low-carb sriracha sauce, fresh coriander, fresh mint, fresh red chillies, lime wedges, bean sprouts...</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick skillet very lightly oiled, over medium high heat,  add the onion and ginger and toast to get some extra flavour into your stock. 
  2. Once they are properly roasted, add the oil and your meat if it is raw and cook. 
  3. Add in the stock and the spices and let it cook for about 10 minutes for the flavours to infuse. 
  4. Meanwhile, spiralise your celeriac! 
  5. Once it has been boiling long enough, fish out the onion and ginger, add your celeriac noodles, cook for about 3 minutes (if you overcook they might break and loose their noodle fun, so careful!) and take off the stove. 
  6. Serve with different choices of the garnishes so each person can choose their own!

A very easy recipe and a great snack!

<ul>
  <li>Sliced ham (you can use slices of chicken ham as well) (Its best that the slices are not too thin.</li>
  <li>Whatever cheese you like best: I like mixing cream cheese with roquefort. </li>
  <li>Other ingredients to taste: raisins, olives, walnuts... <i>(You cannot use any fresh ingredients like arugula since you wouldn't be able to freeze it later.)</i></li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Spread the cheese on the ham, and then put the topping you want. 
  2. Roll over itself as if it were a rug, then cover in some aluminum foil to make sure it holds the shape; after that, freeze for at least one hour.
  3. Take out of the freezer and, while it is still cold, cut in little thin wheels. 
  4. Wait for about 20 minutes until they defreeze all the way through and serve.

Tandoori chicken with easily available spices - you have no excuse not to make it now, Marta !


<ul>
  <li>4 chicken thighs, with bone (if boneless, should be around 800 g)</li>
  <li>1 cup yoghurt (10% fat)</li>
  <li>Ginger paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>Garlic paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>4 tsp paprika </li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili</li>
  <li>3 tsp coriander powder</li>
  <li>1.5 tsp cumin</li>

  <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt (start with less and add to taste)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
* **Process**

  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours. **_Very important to marinate properly in this case since we are using less spices; otherwise the chicken might be bland._**
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
  5. Put the chicken on the griddle and a baking sheet underneath to collect any juices.
  6. Cook until dry and crunchy, at least 30 minutes.
  7. Let rest a couple of minutes before serving.

This simplified version of Goi Ga, a vietnamese salad, is a unique combination of flavours. Don´t miss it! 

You can change the ingredients slightly to fit your macros (for example, using more chicken). If you are doing keto, you might want to add some more oil to the recipe.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 a head of cabbage  (600g) <i>(Can be subbed for salad, but it won´t be the same)</i></li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 cup Bean sprouts</li>
  <li>1/2 red onion (50g)</li>
  <li>Fresh mint (aprox. 1/2 cup) (essential!)</li>
  <li>Cubed cooked boneless chicken thighs (2 chicken thighs, 300 g when raw)</li>
  <li><i>Optional: 1/4 cup fresh coriander</i></li>
  <li>Optional: One carrot (if using, carb count will increase)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup peanuts (100g) or almonds, fried or toasted, chopped</li>
  <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple vinager if not available)</li>
  <li>Stevia to taste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive or coconut oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp lime or lemon juice</li>
  <li>1-2 clove of garlic very finely chopped (or coarsely chopped, letting it infuse and then fishing it out)</li>
  <li>Optional: 3-4 chopped spring onion (45 g)</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper, pinch of powdered chilli</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Chop everything. It´s very important to slice the cabbage very finely. 
  2. Make the dressing with the olive, vinegar, lemon juice, fish sauce, garlic, salt, pepper and chili. Then add enough stevia to have a mostly sweet dressing but that still has some acidic hints to it. 
  3. Put everything in a salad bowl, dress it, mix and serve.

This is a very typical indian entrée, that can be made with chicken, paneer, or even vegetables like mushrooms. I like to have it as a main course with a big green salad with lots of olive oil, as well as some fresh tomato, red onions and coriander. 

If you cannot find tandoori masala, you can use [this recipe instead](http://maria.recipes/chickenTandoori2)

<ul>
  <li>4 chicken thighs, with bone (if boneless, should be around 800 g)</li>
  <li>1 cup yoghurt (10% fat)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp tandoori masala</li>
  <li>Ginger paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>Garlic paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt (start with less and add to taste)</li>
  <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
  
* **Process**
  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours.
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
  5. Put the chicken on the griddle and a baking sheet underneath to collect any juices.
  6. Cook until dry and crunchy, at least 30 minutes.
  7. Let rest a couple of minutes before serving.

This can be used to substitute couscous or rice as a sidedish, as well as in some recipes. I usually either make it in the microwave with some salt, or stir fry it with a bit of oil. I will post some of the things I like to make, but would love to hear your ideas!

<ul>
  <li>1 cauliflower, fresh, cut into florets, clean and dry</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  - If using a **foodprocessor**: rinse the cauliflower florets and, once dry, introduce in the processor (2-3 batches per cauliflower) and process until you get a rice or couscous consistency, abouy 30-60 seconds. 
  - If using a **mixer**: rinse the cauliflower and introduce in batches in the standing mixer with some water and mix; once acquired the desired texture, drain. 
  - If using a **grater**: rince the cauliflower properly and grate patiently.

These are many different sauces to dip your momos in; however, the one I liked most is the sesame achar, that is the one I had more often in Nepal. 

This is the version I have found to be closest to what I remembered. I do hope you enjoy it!


* 2 tbsp sesame seeds
* 1 onion
* 1/2 tbsp ginger paste
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2 red chillies, desseded or whole (depending on how spicy you want it)
* 2 tomatoes
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* Salt, black pepper
* _Optional: 1 tsp tomato paste_
* _Optional: 1/2 cup fresh coriander_

* **Process** 

  1. In a casserole, warm up some oil with the sesame seeds.

  3. Add the rest of ingredients except the coriander and some water to cover. Turn the heat down to low. _Don't add too much water or the final result will be too runny._

  4. Simmer until the vegetables are broken down.

  5. Take out the peel of the tomatoes and then process everything along with the coriander to get a smooth mixture. You can run it through a sieve it you want it to be smoother.

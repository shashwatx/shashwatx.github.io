This is an easy week-night dinner that my mom would make quite often when I was a kid. It was one of the few vegetable dishes that I actually enjoyed! 

I tweaked it a little bit to make it lower carb and higher in fat, and the result is delicious :D 


<ul>
    <li>One big eggplant (550-600g)</li>
    <li>50 g of tuna (canned in brine)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (40 g) parmesan</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch of chili to taste</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, cut the eggplant lenthgwise and cook it until it is tender: you can cook it in the microwave, in the oven or in a pan.
  2. Once cooked through, use a spoon to scoop out the flesh of the eggplant, leaving the skin and part of the flesh to stuff later.
  3. In a bowl, chop the eggplant flesh finely, and then add all the other ingredients (leave some of the parmesan to use as topping) and mix.
  4. Use the mixture to fill in the eggplant skins. Top with more cheese.
  5. Warm up for the filling to set, either in the microwave or in the oven.

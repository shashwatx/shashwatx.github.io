This simplified version of Goi Ga, a vietnamese salad, is a unique combination of flavours. Don´t miss it! 

You can change the ingredients slightly to fit your macros (for example, using more chicken). If you are doing keto, you might want to add some more oil to the recipe.

<ul>
  <li>1/2 a head of cabbage  (600g) <i>(Can be subbed for salad, but it won´t be the same)</i></li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 cup Bean sprouts</li>
  <li>1/2 red onion (50g)</li>
  <li>Fresh mint (aprox. 1/2 cup) (essential!)</li>
  <li>Cubed cooked boneless chicken thighs (2 chicken thighs, 300 g when raw)</li>
  <li><i>Optional: 1/4 cup fresh coriander</i></li>
  <li>Optional: One carrot (if using, carb count will increase)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup peanuts (100g) or almonds, fried or toasted, chopped</li>
  <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple vinager if not available)</li>
  <li>Stevia to taste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive or coconut oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp lime or lemon juice</li>
  <li>1-2 clove of garlic very finely chopped (or coarsely chopped, letting it infuse and then fishing it out)</li>
  <li>Optional: 3-4 chopped spring onion (45 g)</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper, pinch of powdered chilli</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Chop everything. It´s very important to slice the cabbage very finely. 
  2. Make the dressing with the olive, vinegar, lemon juice, fish sauce, garlic, salt, pepper and chili. Then add enough stevia to have a mostly sweet dressing but that still has some acidic hints to it. 
  3. Put everything in a salad bowl, dress it, mix and serve.

_This simplified version of Goi Ga, a vietnamese salad, is a unique combination of flavours. Don´t miss it!_

* **Ingredients**
  * 1/4 of a head of cabbage 
   - _Can be subbed for salad, but it won´t be the same_
  * _Optional: Bean sprouts_
  * Fresh mint (aprox. 1/2 cup) - **essential**
  * Coocked chicken (I prefer breast), in pieces
   - _This is a great way to useleftover chicken lying around your fridge!_
  * _Optional: 1/4 cup fresh coriander_
  * One carrot
  * 1/4 cup peanuts (or cashew nuts) fried or toasted, chopped
  * _Optional: red pepper_
  * For the dressing: 
   - 2 tbsp rice vinager (or apple vinager if not available)
   - 2 tbsp sugar or stevia, or to taste
   - 4 tbsp lime or lemon juice
   - 1 clove of garlic very finely chopped (or coarsely chopped, letting it infuse and then fishing it out)
   - _Optional: 3-4 chopped green shallots_
   - Salt, black pepper, pinch of powdered chilli 

* **Process**
  1. Chop everything. It´s very important to slice the cabbage very finely. 
  2. Put everything in a salad bowl, dress it, mix and serve.

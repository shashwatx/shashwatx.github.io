* **Ingredients**, _serves 2_
  * 2 medium zucchini
  * 2 eggs
  * 1 tbsp milk
  * 1/4 cup (about 20 g) of grated parmesan, _plus extra for serving._
  * 60 g pancetta, chopped. _I use jamon serrano, a cured spanish ham, instead. Some people use bacon, but I don't like the smoky taste._
  * Good amount of salt and pepper

* **Process**
  1. In a bowl, mix the eggs, milk and parmesan with a pinch of salt and a lot of black pepper. Leave on the side for later. 
  2. Spiralize the zucchini. 
  3. Put a big pot of salted water to boil. 
  4. Meanwhile, in a small pan with 1-2 teaspoons of oil over medium-high, crisp up the pancetta for about 5 minutes. 
  5. Boil the zucchini for 2 minutes. 
   - _You could also stir fry them in a pan with a tablespoon of oil, but I prefer boiling them so they cook more evenly._
  6. Drain the zucchini noodles and then put them back into the empty, warm pot, onto the stove, on low heat. Now, very slowly and while stirring, add in the egg mixture so it coats the zucchini. Once it's done, throw in the pancetta and mix. 
   - _It's very difficult to drain the noodles perfectly, so you will probably end up with a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan. No problem; just scoop the "pasta" out and leave the water behind!_
  7. Serve with parmesan and some more black pepper on top. 

Such a healthy way to enjoy a traditionally indulgent dish!

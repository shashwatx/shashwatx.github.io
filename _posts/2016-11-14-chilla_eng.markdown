This is an indian appetizer from the region of Gujarat: vegan savory pancakes made with moong lentils, and filled with anything you like. They can be had plain with chutney, or filled with paneer (like I did), tomato onion and coriander, or whatever you fancy. 
They are usually had with tea in the afternoon, but I like them as a lunch or dinner appetizer: they are light, full of protein and everybody likes them, even the biggest of carnivores!


* **Ingredients**, makes 4 chilla_
  - 1/2 moong dal, preferibly peeled (100 g)
  - 1/8 tsp baking soda
  - 1/8 tsp asafoetida (you can substitute it with 1/2 clove of garlic, smashed into a paste)
  - 1/4 tsp salt  
  - Chilli to taste (preferibly green chili paste)
  - A few drops of stevia (equivalent to 2 tsp sugar)
  - FIlling to taste; in this case, 50 g paneer (or cottage cheese), 1/2 tsp Chaat masala (optional), 4 tbsp fresh coriander
  - 2 tsp oil (for cooking)


* **Process**
  1. Wash the lentils properly, then soak them for 3-4 hours. 
  2. Drain, add 3 tbsp water and grind into a fine paste. If necessary you can add more water. You should end up with a pancake-like batter. 
  3. Add the salt, baking soda, asafoetida and stevia and mix well. 
  4. Lightly grease a pan or tawa (with 1/2 tsp oil per chilla it is usually enough) and put it over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 of the batter and use a spatula to make a thin disk of about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Put the filling on top while it cooks; in this case, paneer, coriander and a bit of chaat masala. 
  6. When the batter starts to dry in the top (about 2-3 minutes), flip it, cook another minute, flip again and fold it in half to keep the filling inside. Proceed with the other chilla. 
  7. Serve them with more paneer, coriander, chaat masala, tomato and onion, or with your favorite chutney.

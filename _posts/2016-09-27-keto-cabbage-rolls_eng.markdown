This is not really a new recipe; I just adapted my [previous cabbage roll recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRollso) to decrease the carbs, filling them with soy granules and seeds. They are as good as the original recipe, and this time I made a video on how to make the wraps. I hope you like them. 



<ul>
    <li>One whole cabbage head (we will use the 8 outer leaves, about 260 g)</li>
    <li>70 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds (65g), chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1/2 onion (80g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Spices: 1 tsp spicy paprika,</li> 
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li> 
    <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li> 
    <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li> 
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups of tomato pur√©e (passata)</li> 
    <li>6 cloves</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>A pinch of salt</li> 
    <li>Some sugar or stevia (optional)</li> 
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. First, boil the whole cabbage. I made it in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes. Then, cool with water to stop any further cooking. 
  2. Hydrate the soy granules. Meanwhile, gently fry the onion with 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and bay leaf.
    * If you want the onion to be extra soft and sweet, you can make it like I did  [in my other recipe](http://maria.recipes/cabbageRolls)
  3. Once the onion is soft, add the spices and cook for a minute. Then, add the soy, seeds and tomato paste. Cook for 5 more minutes and then let it cool. You can add fresh parsley or coriander if you like it.
  4. Take the 8 outer cabbage leaves. Put them flat over a surface and, with a knife, trim the stem without cutting all the way through.
  5. Divide the soy mixture into eight, and put a portion onto each cabbage leaf. Then, wrap like I show in the video. 
  6. Put the rolls in a big pot in one or two layers, leaving little space between them. Mix the ingredients for the sauce (all the other ingredients) and pour over the rolls. 
  7. Let them boil for about 30 minutes.
  8. Serve with flax bread, rice, salad...

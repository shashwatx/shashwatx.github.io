This is a very typical indian entr√©e, that can be made with chicken, paneer, or even vegetables like mushrooms. I like to have it as a main course with a big green salad with lots of olive oil, as well as some fresh tomato, red onions and coriander. 

If you cannot find tandoori masala, you can use [this recipe instead](http://maria.recipes/chickenTandoori2)

<ul>
  <li>4 chicken thighs, with bone (if boneless, should be around 800 g)</li>
  <li>1 cup yoghurt (10% fat)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp tandoori masala</li>
  <li>Ginger paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>Garlic paste - 2 tbsp</li>
  <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt (start with less and add to taste)</li>
  <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
  <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
  
**Process**
  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours.
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
  5. Put the chicken on the griddle and a baking sheet underneath to collect any juices.

  7. Let rest a couple of minutes before serving.

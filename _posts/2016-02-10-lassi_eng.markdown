Mango lassi is the indian smoothie, and a very popular drink. Made with mango and cardamom, it is a delicious drink to have for dessert, mid afternoon, or any time you want. 


If you can get your hands on some good quality mangoes that have very Little fiber (I hear Alphonso mangoes are the best), this will only require blending everything together. However, most mangoes have a lot of fiber, so I recommend passing the mango puree through a very fine sieve â€“ it makes for a delicious and smooth puree, totally worth it!

* **Ingredients**, _serves 4_
  * One ripe mango
  * 250 g plain yogurt
  * Water or milk
  * Ice
  * _Optional: sugar_
  * _Optional: the sedes of two green cardamom pods, powdered_
  * _Optional: mint for garnishing_

* **Process**
  1. Peel the mango and take the pit out; then, puree the pulp. 
  2. Pass the puree through a fine sieve to geta ll the fibers out of the final result. 
   - _This takes a while, but I feel like it is necessary because it makes a huge difference in the final result._
  3. Process all the ingredients except the ice and the mint. Add some water or milk until you get the desired texture. 
  4. Serve with ice and garnish with mint.

Fresh and delicious!

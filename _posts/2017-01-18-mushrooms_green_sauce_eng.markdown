Parsley, garlic and olive oil are a classic combination in spanish cuisine, and they are often combined in a green sauce that is used for vegetables or fish. 

This is an easy side dish for a weeknight dinner or for serving up to your guests. 

<ul>
  <li>200 g white button mushrooms, only caps</li>
  <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 small clove of garlic</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste (optional)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley: a handful (about 1/4 cup)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Blend the olive oil, garlic, spices, lemon juice, vinegar and parsley (traditionally, a morter and pestle should be used).
  2. Put the mushrooms over medium-low on a lightly greased pan. Cover with a lid and cook for about 10 minutes turning them halfway through, until they are soft. 
  3. Take them out, sprinkle with a bit of salt and fill them with a bit of the green sauce.

In my family everybody loves "boquerones en vinagre", a typical spanish appetizer made of raw anchovies that are dipped in vinager until they change their texture, and then eaten with olive oil and garlic. However, I am not a big fan of raw fish, and since I am trying to base my eating in plants, I remembered I heard abuot vegans making "calabac√≠n en vinagre", zucchini in vinager, so I thought I would give it a go. 

And yes, it was a great idea! The texture and flavor are perfect to eat as they are with some beer in summer, or in a light and fresh salad. 



* **Ingredients**
  - Zucchini
  - White vinager
  - Extra virgin olive oil
  - Salt
  - Garlic
  - Fresh parsley



* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini very thin using a potato peeler, to form thin strips. Add a little bit of salt.
  2. Put the zucchini in a deep dish, cover in vinager and let it rest in the vinager overnight (8 hours). 
   - _It's best not to leave it for too long; if left for 24 hours, it tastes too much like vinager!_
  3. Take it out from the meat and drain properly.
  4. Put the zucchini in layers in a plate and add the oil, chopped garlic and parsley.
  5. Leave it to rest for at least an hour. 
  6. It's done.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup dal (dry lentils); I like using red lentils, which cook fast</li>
  <li>3 onions</li>
  <li>Optional: tomato, peppers or any veggies lying around the kitchen</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh green chillies to taste (I use 3)</li>
  <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste (about 2 garlic cloves)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tsp  garam masala (to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Optional, to garnish: lemon, fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. En a casserole, put water with a pinch of turmeric and the dal; once boiling, cover and simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally.
  2. Meanwhile, in a pan, add some oil and the cumin seeds. 
  3. Once the cumin is golden, add the chili and onions (and any other vegetable you might use that takes long to cook).
  4. Cook on medium heat until the onion is tender. 
  5. Add the garlic and the ginger paste and cook stirring for a minute.
  6. Add the other spices.
     * _At this point you could add soft vegetables such as tomatoes and let them cook for a couple of minutes._
  7. Cook about 30 sec-1 min, then turn off the heat. 
  8. During this time, the dal should've been cooking; the simmering time depends on the type of lentil and your taste (30-60min)
     * _I don't mind if my dal stil has some texture to it, but if you leave it long enough, it will form a puree like in the video_
     * _If the dal is too liquid, turn up the heat and cook uncovered a couple of minutes; if it's too dense, add a splash of water._
  9. Mix in the vegetables with the dal and cook together for 5-10 minutes.

Serve with a splash of lemon juice and some fresh coriander.

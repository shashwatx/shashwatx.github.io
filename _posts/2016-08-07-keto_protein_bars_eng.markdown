An easy way to make your own protein bars, low on carbs, vegan, and only four ingredients. 

This is my version, where I am using sunbutter, but according to the [original recipe](http://meatfreeketo.com/homemade-keto-protein-bar-formula/), any type of nut or seed butter will work, and you can change the proportions to your liking.

* **Ingredients**, _for 6 bars_
  * 6 tbsp cream cheese
  * 6 tbsp sunbutter, or nut/seed butter of choise
  * 80 g protein powder (I use soy and oat, chocolate flavor)
  * 2 tbsp coconut oil


* **Process**
  1. Mix everything except the oil with patience. If it is dry, add the oil a bit at a time; i needed 2 tbsp. You should end up with a firm dough, similar to play-doh.
  2. Let it cool down in the fridge.
  3. Cut in 6 equal pieces.

Stuff your face with these low carb waffles. You won't regret it.

<ul>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>30 g cream cheese</li>
  <li>1 tbsp coconut flour (8g)</li>
  <li>0.5-1 tbsp erythritol</li>
  <li>1/6 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp butter to grease the waffle maker</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Mix the coconut flour, baking powder and salt. 
  2. Blend the egg, cream cheese and erythritol. Then add the coconut flour mixture. 
   - _If you are making the batter the night before, you might have to add a splash of heavy whipping cream as it can get very dense otherwise_  
  3. Grease the waffle maker with butter. 
  4. Pour all the batter for one waffle and cook. 
  5. Eat with your favorite low-carb topping!

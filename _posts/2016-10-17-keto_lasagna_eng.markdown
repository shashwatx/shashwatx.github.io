I am so happy about this lasagna! It is vegetarian (and can be vegan if you use a vegan milk and omit the mozzarella) and low-carb, and it is as good as the traditional one!

For the sauce, you can combine milk and heavy cream as you want, and/or use vegetarian milks to lower the carb count. In my case, i used soy milk mixed with single cream.


<ul>
    <li>2 medium zucchini (400 g)</li>
    <li>2/3 chopped onion (75 g)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato pur√©e</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>50 g soy granules</li>
    <li>1 tbsp flax meal</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp psyllium powder</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li> 
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Cut the zucchini in thin strips of about 2 mm thick. Then cook with a little bit of olive oil on a non-stick pan, in the microwave or steam them, until they are slightly softer but not completely mushy!  
  2. Hydrate the soy in salty water or in stock.
  3. Fry the onion on medium heat about 10 minutes until it is soft. After, add the rest of ingredients and 1/2 cup of water and let everything boil until you have a nice thick sauce.
  4. For the white sauce: warm up the water and cream with the nutmeg and some salt. Then add the psyllium and mix very well (you might need a hand mixer). Adjust the texture bu adding more psyllium or more milk. 
  5. Make the lasagna alternating layers of zucchini and soy mixture, and use the bechamel to cover everything. Then add the mozzarella on top.  
  6. Bake at 180-200C for 30 minutes, putting it under the broiler in the last 5 min.

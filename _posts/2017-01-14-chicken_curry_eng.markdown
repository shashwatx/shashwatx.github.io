Easiest recipe for a delicious Chicken Curry. It won't be as good as the recipes that use real indian spices and blends... but it is pretty darn good anyway :) 

<ul>
  <li>8 chicken drumsticks, with skin and bone (1 kg)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp coconut oil</li>
  <li>1/2 big onion or one medium (110g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste or 1 inch ginger</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste or one big clove of garlic</li>
  <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
  <li>1 cup of coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/4-1 cup of water depending on desired sauce</li>
  <li><i>Optional:coriander to garnish</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. In a pot or a pressure cooker, in two batches, sear the meat (with some salt) for about 3 minutes, using 1 tbsp oil per batch. Set the seared drumsticks aside. 
  2. Pur√©e the onion, ginger and garlic. 
  3. Heat up the other 2 tbsp oil and fry the onion paste, with salt and pepper, over medium heat for about 10 minutes until it smells sweet. 
  4. Add the curry powder. Cook for 60 seconds, then add the coconut milk and water (add water depending on how thick you want your sauce; add more water if you will be cooking on an open pot). Mix well until the sauce is even. 
  5. When it comes to a boil, add the chicken back in. Now cook on an open flame on low heat for about 45-60 minutes or in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes until the meat is tender. 
  6. Garnish with coriander and serve.

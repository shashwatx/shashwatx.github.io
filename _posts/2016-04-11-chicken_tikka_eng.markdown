Chicken tikka, that can also be made with paneer or tofu, is an easy to make appetizer, very versatile to add to other dishes, or to just eat it plain.

I like to make it with big chunks of onion and red bell pepper, to have more color and different flavors. 

It is good as it is, in salad or sandwiches, and it is also the base for the typical dish Chicken Tikka Masala, one of the most popular foods at indian restaurants. 


<ul>
  <li>2 big chicken breasts (600g), cubed, or 500 g paneer or firm tofu, cubed</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (125g) greek-style yoghurt. <i>Use vegan yoghurt and tofu for a vegan dish</i></li>
  <li>Optional: 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp chili or to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp ginger paste, 1 tbsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 onion and 1/2 red bell pepper, in big chunks</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and marinate for at least 2 hours.
  2. Put the meat, onion and pepper into skewers and on an oven tray. (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for a couple of hours and then cover the part that doesn't have meat with some aluminum foil).
   - Another option, instead of making it in the oven, is to make it in a pan over high heat with some oil, without skewers.
  3. Put under the grill for 20 min turning it every 5 and pouring some of the marination sauce on top if it dries out.
  4. Once it starts getting slightly burnt in the corners, it is done.
  5. Use for tikka masala, pizza, sandwiches, salad...

A great, easy, tasty, keto recipe. My family adores it, it literally takes 10-15 minutes to make, and is super filling. You have to try it!

Add more oil if you want it to be more filling, or accompany with a fatty vegetable side dish.


* **Ingredients**, _serves 4_
  - 2 salmon fillets, about 1 inch thick (14 oz in total)
  - 1 tbsp coconut oil
  - The green part of 3 leeks (cut out the ends) OR one whole leek (90g)
  - 1 tsp fresh ginger paste
  - 1/4 tsp salt  
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 1 tbsp soy sauce
  - 3 tbsp water
  - 2 tbsp lemon juice
  - Stevia or sweetener to taste (equals 1-2 tsp sugar)
  - 1/2 tbsp sesame oil
  - Optional: coriander for garnishing


* **Process**
  1. Melt the coconut oil over high heat. Then fry the ginger for 2 minutes.
  2. Add the leeks, salt and pepper. Cook stirring frequently for about 5 minutes, until soft.
  3. Add the salmon and cook on high for 2 minutes on each side.
  4. Add the soy sauce and water, cook for 30 seconds, then cover and reduce to low heat until the salmon is cooked through.
  5. Once cooked, add the lemon juice, stevia and sesame oil, mix well and serve.

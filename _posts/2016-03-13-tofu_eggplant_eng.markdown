A very easy to make, healthy and tasty recipe. The different flavours combine perfectly, and I often omit the ham for a vegan version. Steaming the eggplant makes the flavour stand out a lot, which I find lovely, but if you are not an eggplant fan, this is not for you!

<ul>
  <li>2 eggplants</li>
  <li>100 g cubed tofu</li>
  <li>50-100 g cubed or sliced and chopped ham (optional; can be omitted for a vegan version)</li>
  <li>For the sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp white whine (or 1 tbsp vinager and a bit of honey, to taste), optional: 1-2 cloves of garlic finely chopped, optional: 1/2 tsp ginger paste, ground black pepper, salt (depending on how salty the soy sauce is), 1 tbsp corn starch</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, or fresh parsley for those who don't like coriander</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Prepare a pan in which you will steam the eggplant.
  2. Cut the eggplants lenghtwise and make some cuts into the flesh without going all the way through.
  3. Put the eggplants on the recipient where you will steam them later.. 
  4. Put the ham and tofu on top, and then pour the sauce over everything for it to impregnate the eggplant. Garnish with a little bit of coriander or parsley.
   - _Don't spill the sauce; if there is too much, keep it and add it a couple of minutes before it is done cooking._
  5. Steam for about 25 minutes until the eggplants are tender. Add some more coriander or parsley, then serve.

These are the cutest little fat bombs I have made! They have an almond-butter crust and a creamy lemon filling, full of coconut oil goodness! They are also gluten-free and can be adapted for a dairy-free version, as well!

If you want to have a third layer, add a tablespoon of lemon or strawberry gellatin on top. That would be even lovelier!


<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup almond meal (I used crushed roasted almonds)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup flax meal</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>A pinch of stevia or erythritol (to taste; I used about 1/2 tsp of truvia)</li>
    <li>25 g melted butter or coconut oil</li>
    <li>5 tbsp coconut oil, melted</li>
    <li>The zest of one lemon</li>
    <li>60 g cream cheese (substitute for coconut cream for dairy-free)</li>
    <li>1-2 tbsp lemon juice (to taste)</li>
    <li>Stevia or erythritol, to taste (I used 1 tbsp truvia)</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients for the crust: almonds, flax, salt, pinch of stevia. Then add the butter and mix until you have a dough that doesn't crumble. If necessary, add some more butter.
  2. Blend all the ingredients for the cream: coconut oil, zest, cream cheese, lemon juice, sweetener and vanilla extract.
  3. Using small molds (I used ice cream cubes), put a layer of the base and then a layer of the cream on top. I made 16 small fat bombs. 
  5. Let it harden in the fridge (1-2 hours), then take out of the mold. Keep in the fridge until consumed. They will last 4-5 days in the fridge in an air-tight container.

This is a dish that my bae and I love. He is usually not a big fan of vegetables, but when I make this, it disappears in no time! And I love it too not just because of the flavour, but because it takes very little time to make (the most annoying part is chopping the vegetables!).

The final result is very good, and combines wonderfully with some plain basmati rice. For those who want to, sometimes I like to add some pan-fried paneer or tofu to have some more protein in my meal. 

An easy and  yummy curry, it's worth trying!


<ul>
  <li>250 g sliced mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 medium brown onion (110g), finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 medium-sized tomato (140g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp powdered chili (or to taste)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</li>
  <li>Lemon juice: 1 tbsp or to taste</li>
  <li>Optional: fresh coriander to garnish</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, add the onion with a bit of salt and brown them for about 5 minutes. 
  2. Add the garlic and ginger and let them cook for 1-2 minutes, so they loose their "raw" flavour. 
  3. Turn down the heat and add the powdered spices and let them roast for about a minute to become more fragrant (if the pan is too dry and the spices might burn, add a bit of water). 
  4. Add the mushrooms with a bit of salt, mix, turn the heat to medium and cover. 
  5. Cook stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes until the mushrooms are almost cooked. 
  6. Add the tomato and the tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes until the tomato is broken down. 
  7. Turn off the stove, add the fenugreek leaves crushing them between your fingers, add some lemon juice and serve. If you like, you can garnish with some coriander, too!

This sauce is THE BOMB. Low-carb. Keto. Vegan. Delicious. 

I just had it with shredded seitan over some salad. Yum! <3

* **Ingredients**, _for 1.5-2 cups of sauce_
  * 1/3 onion, chopped
  * 2 tbsp coconut oil
  * 3 cloves garlic, chopped
  * 1 can of tomato sauce (425 g)
  * 3 tsp liquid smoke
  * 1 tsp soy sauce
  * 1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)
  * 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
  * 1/2 tsp smoked spicy paprika
  * 1 tbsp tomato paste
  * 1/2 tsp salt (or more to taste)
  * 1/4 tsp pepper
  * Sweetener of choice - I used stevia and just added until I liked it. If you want your sauce to be very sweet, you might consider mixing two different sweeteners to avoid any aftertaste. 

* **Process**
  1. In a saucepan, warm up the oil and then fry the garlic and onion over low heat for about 10 minutes, until they are very soft.
  2. Take it off the heat and once it cools down a bit (otherwise it will make a mess), add all the ingredients. 
  3. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. 
  4. Once it is done simmering, check for salt and add sweetener to taste. 
  5. _Optional: blend the sauce for a smooth texture_

This is a very easy dish with few ingredients, full of fiber, very healthy, and keto-friendly.

I don't eat meat so I'm using seitan that I minced, but for omnivores, you could use ground meat (preferably a very fatty one, which would make this higher in fat).

<ul>
    <li>1/2 medium cabbage, thinly sliced (400g)</li>
    <li>1/6 red onion (30 g), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>80 g seitan minced, OR minced meat</li>
    <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
    <li>1/2 or 1 whole garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce + 1/4 tsp kelp powder (optional) OR 1 tbsp soy sauce + 2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp tahini paste or peanut butter</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>Sweetener of choice - I used stevia</li>
    <li>To serve: lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, fry the ginger and garlic on the oil for 30 seconds.
  2. Add the cabbage and onion. Cook covered on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the soy sauce, kelp, tahini, black pepper and chili powder.
  3. When it starts to soften, add the seitan (or meat)and mix. Cook for another 2 minutes. 
  4. Then,add the sauce, mix and cook for a couple of minutes. 
  5. When the cabbage is soft, add the eggs as shown in the video: add them raw and mix fast, so they cook covering the cabbage to make it moist.

This is a very easy dish with few ingredients, full of fiber, very healthy, and keto-friendly.

I don't eat meat so I'm using seitan that I minced, but for omnivores, you could use ground meat (preferably a very fatty one, which would make this higher in fat).

* **Ingredients**, _serves 3_
  * 1/2 medium cabbage, thinly sliced (400g)
  * 1/6 red onion (30 g), thinly sliced
  * 80 g seitan minced, OR minced meat
  * 2 tbsp coconut oil
  * 1/2 or 1 whole garlic clove, minced
  * 1 tsp ginger paste
  * 3 tbsp soy sauce + 1/4 tsp kelp powder (optional) OR 1 tbsp soy sauce + 2 tbsp fish sauce
  * 1/2 tbsp tahini paste or peanut butter
  * 1/4 tsp pepper
  * 1/4 tsp of red chili paste (or to taste)
  * 2 eggs
  * To serve: lemon juice, sweetener of choice - I used stevia. 

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, fry the ginger and garlic on the oil for 30 seconds.
  2. Add the cabbage and onion. Cook covered on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the soy sauce, kelp, tahini, black pepper and chili powder.
  3. When it starts to soften, add the seitan (or meat)and mix. Cook for another 2 minutes. 
  4. Then,add the sauce, mix and cook for a couple of minutes. 
  5. When the cabbage is soft, add the eggs as shown in the video: add them raw and mix fast, so they cook covering the cabbage to make it moist.

These little coconut balls are one of my favourite things to serve during christmas. The original recipe called for egg and then required some baking, but I decided to substitute the egg to avoid the baking part!

They are incredibly easy to make, healthy, and so delicious!

* **Ingredients**
  * 250 g mashed sweet potato (baked, microwaved or boiled sweet potato, then mashed with a fork)
  * 150 g sugar or to taste (can be substituted for stevia)
  * 30 g powdered biscuits, tea-biscuit or wafer type (mine were low on sugar and vanilla flavour)
  * 1/4-1/2 tsp vainilla extract (can be omitted if the biscuits are flavoured)
  * 150 g shredded coconut
  * Some extra shredded coconut, to coat the balls

* **Process**
  1. Mix all the ingredients to make a smooth mixture. If it is not thick enough to form the balls, add some more powdered biscuits.
  2. Form some balls and then coat them with the shredded coconut.
  3. Let it cold down a little bit in the fridge before serving it so they harden a little bit.

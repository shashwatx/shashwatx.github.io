Falafel are a sort of "meatball" made of chickpeas, typical from the Middle East. they are traditionally vegan and deep-fried. 

I am not a bit fan of frying (not just because of the fat, but because I'm actually a bit scared!) so I've been trying to find a good no-fry falafel recipe. But most of the ones I found used eggs, or ended up adding a whole lot of breadcrumbs into the mixture, or something of the sort...

So I thought I should try with chickpeas + chickpea flour, and the result is very good. The first time they were completely oil-free; they were tasty but a little bit dry, so I would recommend you use it.

You will get crunchy falafel with a moist inside, perfect for any time.


* **Ingredients**, _makes 16-20 falafel_
  - 400 g boiled chickpeas
  - 1 small onion
  - 1 (or 2) garlic cloves
  - A handful of parsley, aprox 1/2 cup (you can substitute half or everything for fresh coriander)
  - 4 tbsp chickpea flour
  - 2 tsp powdered coriander
  - 2 tsp powdered cumin
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp baking soda
  - 3 tbsp of olive oil (you can add a bit more if you want to)

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C
  2. Process all of the ingerdients until you have a firm mixture.
  3. With your hands, form your falafel as little balls or disks, and put them in a greased oven tray, without them touching one another.
  4. Bake for about half an hour, or until they are slightly golden and crunchy on the outside.


Serse with tahini dip, with yoghurt and mint sauce, in a pita bread sandwich... Whatever you like best.

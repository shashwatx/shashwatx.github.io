A good way of sneaking some vegetables inside of the pizza... It's very hard to tell the crust is made of cauliflower!

And it's a great way of having a low-carb, high-fiber dinner. 

Don't be skeptical and give it a try. It is delicious!

<ul>
  <li>1 big cauliflower or 5 cups (600g) of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a></li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan (70g)</li>
</ul>
* **Process**
  1. Put the cauliflower rice in two batches in the microwave for 5 minutes. Afterwards, put all the cooked cauliflower into a clean teatowel, fold it and squeeze as much water as you can. If your arms are starting to hurt, you are doing it right. You should spend 5 or 10 minutes doing this, so the final result has good consistency.
  2. Once squeezed properly, mix all the ingredients and preheat your oven to 180C
  3. Poner la masa sobre un papel de horno en una bandeja de horno y darle forma con las manos. 
   - _The thickness depends on your taste, but it should be even. For pizza I make it 0.3 cm thick, but you can also make tortillas making it very thin, and later on use them for wraps._
  4. Bake until golden. It is a good idea to put it on the lower part of the oven for the last couple of minutes so that the base doesn't end up soggy.
  5. Take out of the oven, put the toppings you like, bake it for a couple more minutes so the cheese melts, and... _voil√†!_

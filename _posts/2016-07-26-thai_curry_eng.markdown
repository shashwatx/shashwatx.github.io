Super easy and incredibly delicious recipe. Can be vegan and gluten-free, and is full of fiber, flavor, healthy fats â€“ and great for keto-ers! Just add some more fat to fit your macros.

I like to at it with a big green salad and some keto bread. Makes for an awesome meal to pack for work!


* **Ingredients**, _serves 4_
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 270 g tofu
  - 1/3 of a purple onion, thinly sliced
  - 1 tsp ginger paste
  - For the sauce: 100 g spinach, cooked (I use frozen spinach that I then cook in the microwave!), 1/3 cup of coconut milk, 1/4 tsp powdered cumin, 1 tsp powdered coriander, 1/4 tsp red chili powder (or more to taste), 1/4 tsp black pepper, _2 basil leaves optional_, sugar to taste (I used stevia), 2 tbsp soy sauce 
    - _You can use 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp of fish sauce if you are a pescetarian, to increase the umami!_
  - Vegetables, to taste - I used half a bunch of broccoli (previously steamed, although you can use it raw and let it cook longer) and 60 g of carrot
  - _Optional: some fresh coriander_
  - To garnish: 30 g roasted or fried almonds or peanuts, chopped; lime

* **Process**
  1. Start by frying the onion, ginger and carrots over medium heat
  2. In a blender, blend the ingredients for the sauce. Set aside for later. 
  3. Once the onions are very soft, add the tofu and cook over medium-high until it gets golden.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until they are tender (I used steamed broccoli so I only cooked it for 2 minutes so it would warm up). 
  5. Add the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. 
  6. Turn of the heat, sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve with some lemon or lime.

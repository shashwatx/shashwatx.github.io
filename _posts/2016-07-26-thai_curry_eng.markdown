Super easy and incredibly delicious recipe. Can be vegan and gluten-free, and is full of fiber, flavor, healthy fats â€“ and great for keto-ers! Just add some more fat to fit your macros, and use whatever vegetables you prefer.

I like to at it with a big green salad and some keto bread. Makes for an awesome meal to pack for work!


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>270 g tofu</li>
    <li>1/3 of a purple onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
    <li>100 g spinach, cooked (I use frozen spinach that I then cook in the microwave!)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of coconut milk</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp powdered cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp powdered coriander</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp red chili powder (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>_2 basil leaves optional_</li>
    <li>Sugar to taste (I used stevia)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (or 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp fish sauce)</li>
    <li>Half a bunch of broccoli (previously steamed, or it raw and let it cook longer)</li>
    <li>60 g of carrot</li>
    <li>_Optional: some fresh coriander_</li>
    <li>To garnish: 30 g roasted or fried almonds or peanuts, chopped</li>
    <li>To garnish: lime</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Start by frying the onion, ginger and carrots over medium heat
  2. In a blender, blend the ingredients for the sauce: spinach, coconut milk, cumin, coriander, chili, black pepper, basil, stevia, soy sauce. Set aside for later. 
  3. Once the onions are very soft, add the tofu and cook over medium-high until it gets golden.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until they are tender (I used steamed broccoli so I only cooked it for 2 minutes so it would warm up). 
  5. Add the sauce and cook for 2 minutes. 
  6. Turn of the heat, sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve with some lemon or lime.

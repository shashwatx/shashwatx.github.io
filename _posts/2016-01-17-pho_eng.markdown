Pho is an amazing vietnamese soup full of bright flavors. I made this version using spiralized celery root instead of noodles - and my boyfriend didn't even realise he was eating vegetables! 

I recommend using good quality stock for this. If you don't want to buy one, you can use the same recipe but add some good quality meat bones, and just let the broth simmer for a couple of hours with the spices, ginger and onion to make your own stock. 


<ul>  
  <li>1/2 celeriac (celery root) (125g)</li>
  <li>1 small brown onion, in 4 big pieces</li>
  <li>About 3 cm piece of ginger, sliced transversally</li>
  <li>Whole spices: half a cinnamon stick, 2 star anise, 1 tsp coriander seeds, 3 cloves, 1 black cardamom (Can be omitted if necessary)</li>
  <li>200 g beef (preferably sirloin), very finely cut across the grain. You could use raw meat, leftovers or chicken. <i>(In order to do this, I cut it when it is slightly frozen.)</i></li>
  <li>4 cups of good chicken or beef stock</li>
  <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>To garnish: low-carb sriracha sauce, fresh coriander, fresh mint, fresh red chillies, lime wedges, bean sprouts...</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick skillet very lightly oiled, over medium high heat,  add the onion and ginger and toast to get some extra flavour into your stock. 
  2. Once they are properly roasted, add the oil and your meat if it is raw and cook. 
  3. Add in the stock and the spices and let it cook for about 10 minutes for the flavours to infuse. 
  4. Meanwhile, spiralise your celeriac! 
  5. Once it has been boiling long enough, fish out the onion and ginger, add your celeriac noodles, cook for about 3 minutes (if you overcook they might break and loose their noodle fun, so careful!) and take off the stove. 
  6. Serve with different choices of the garnishes so each person can choose their own!

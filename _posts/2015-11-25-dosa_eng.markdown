* **Ingredients**
  * 200 g cooked rice
  * 50 g flour
  * 50 g yogurt
  * Salt, to taste (1/4 tsp)

* **Process**
  1. Put all the ingredients in a container. 
  2. Add about 1/4 cup of water and blend. Add more water a bit at a time.
  3. Blend until you get a smooth consistency, like crepe batter.
  4. Let it sit for 10 minutes. 
  5. In a nonstick pan on medium-high heat, slightly greased, pour a splash of the batter. 
  6. Tilt the pan to the sides so the batter distributes properly.
  7. Leave 1-2 minutes on that side and then flip over with a espatula.
     - Be careful in this step because dosas could break.
     - If it does break, pour a little bit of batter on the crack and let it set.
  8. Cook on the other side for two more minutes and transfer into a plate.

Serve plain with chutney or stuff it!

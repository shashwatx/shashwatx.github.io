Although I am not a big fan of mayo, I do feel like eating it every now and then. But it is full of fat, so I rarely buy any. 

Today I bring you a healthier "mayonnaise", that I like to call "Tofunnaise". This eggless sauce is silky and delicious, doesnt require any special skills to make it (no risk of messing up, like with real mayo!), is VERY low fat and is high in protein. 

It is obviously not exactly like the real deal. But it has a very nice flavor and texture, and I am positive you won't miss the mayo if you have tofunnaise!

* **Ingredients**
  * 100 g of firm tofu
  * 40 g of plain yoghurt, use vegan yoghurt for vegan tofunnaise
  * Pinch of salt
  * 1/4 tsp of Dijon mustard (I  like to add 1/2 tsp, but it will have a strong taste)
  * 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  * 1/2 tbsp white vinager
  * 1/2 tbsp lemon juice

* **Process**
  1. Process until smooth. Taste for salt.
  2. Eat.

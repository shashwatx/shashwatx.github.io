This pizza base is seriously awesome. I used [this recipe](http://www.meatfreeketo.com/vegan-fathead-pizza-crust/) but omitted the vegan cheese and used some nutritional yeast instead to get some cheesy flavor. Seriously: this pizza holds its shape perfectly, is chewy and salty and delicious, vegan, and only 3.1 g net carbs for half a pizza crust!


<ul>
  <li>85 g of flax meal (1/2 cup + 1.5 tbsp)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp psyllium husk powder (32 g)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp (6 g) nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water</li>
  <li>For Margharita Pizzaa: 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 cup (110 g) shredded mozzarella (you can use vegan mozzarella, but it will change the macros), 1/2 cup tomato passata, some dried oregano, fresh basil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
  2. In a bowl, mix everything except the water. Then add the water little by little until you form a dough.
  3. Put the dough on a parchment paper, put another paper on top and then spread it out with a rolling pin until it is 2-3 mm thick. Once it is even, cut it out to whichever shape you want (I used a big lid to make it round). If it cracks, use your finger with a little bit of water to smooth it out. 
  4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until it's slightly dry and golden.
  5. Put whichever toppings you want and then bake for another 5-10 minutes.

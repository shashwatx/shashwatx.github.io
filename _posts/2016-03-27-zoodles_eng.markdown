This is, hands down, my favorite spiralized recipe. 

It literally takes 5 minutes to put together, it's healthy, flavourful, balanced... I could eat it every day!

* **Ingredients**, _serves one_
  * 1 medium sized zucchini, spiralized
  * 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  * 2-3 cheese in portions (I use low-fat Laughing Cow cheese)
  * One small can of tuna, drained
  * 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
  * Balsamic vinager, salt, pepper


* **Process**
  1. In a pan, put a teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Once it's hot, add the zoodles and cook with the garlic powder, salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, just enough time for them to start getting soft. 
   - _If overcooked, the zoodles will release water._
  2. Add the cheese and then mix everything, so the cheese melts and forms a sauce. 
  3. Serve with tuna, olive oil and vinager.

This is, hands down, my favorite spiralized recipe. 

It literally takes 5 minutes to put together, it's healthy, flavourful, balanced... I could eat it every day!

<ul>
  <li>1 medium sized zucchini, spiralized (200g)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>3 tbsp cream cheese (45g)</li>
  <li>100g canned tuna, drained</li>
  <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1tbsp Balsamic vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, put a teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Once it's hot, add the zoodles and cook with the garlic powder, salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, just enough time for them to start getting soft. 
   - _If overcooked, the zoodles will release water._
  2. Add the cheese and then mix everything, so the cheese melts and forms a sauce. 
  3. Serve with tuna, olive oil and vinager.

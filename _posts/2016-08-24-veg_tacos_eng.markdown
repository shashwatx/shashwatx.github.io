This is super tasty for taco night, but will work for any recipe in which you want to substitute minced meat - just adapt the spices to the recipe you are using! 

If you are using it for mexican food - I would recommend adding some minced vegan chorizo for a more intense flavor. A recipe will be coming up soon!


<ul>
  <li> 50 g textured soy protein</li>
  <li> 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
  <li> 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
  <li> 1 cup vegetable stock</li>
  <li> 1/2 small red onion (30 g)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh</li>
  <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> Optional: fresh coriander, to garnish</li>
</ul>



* **Process**
  1. Chop the pumpkin seeds roughly. Put the soy and the seeds in a bowl with the soy sauce and the stock for at least 10-15 minutes to hidrate.
  2. Heat up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Fry on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes until it looks soft.
  3. Add the spices and the tomato purée. Mix and cook for about 1 minute.
  4. Add the soy-seed mixture with its liquid and cook for a few minutes until it warms up. You can add more liquid if you want, or dry it out more to your liking.
  5. Turn off the stove, add the lemon juice and coriander and eat!

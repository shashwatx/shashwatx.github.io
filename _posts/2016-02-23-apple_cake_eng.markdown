This is my all-time favourite apple spongecake - eggless, and can be easily adapted into a vegan version. It is so moist and fluffy and lemony, and the pieces of baked apple are perfectly tender. 

This can be made using exclusively vegetable oil (I usually use sunflower oil), but I like to lighten it up substituting half with yoghurt, and it turns out just as fluffy as the full-oil version. Use applesauce instead of yoghurt for a vegan version!


* **Ingredients**
  * 180 g flour (I used whole wheat flour)
  * 30 g cornstarch
    - _Instead of flour and cornstarch, you can use baking flour (low fluten flour)._
  * 16 g baking powder
  * 150 g sugar (I used 100 g and then added a bit of stevia)
  * 150 g milk (you can use almond milk if you want to make a vegan cake)
  * 120 g vegetable oil (1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp) or you can sub half with unsweetened yoghurt or with unsweetened applesauce.
  * The lemon peel grind of one lemon
  * 125-150 g of apple (I use one whole golden apple)


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180 C
  2. In a bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch and the baking powder. In a different bowl, mix the oil, lemon peel grind and the sugar. 
  3. Take a spoonful of the flour mixture and mix it with the apple to coat the cubes. Leave on the side.
  4. Pour the oil mixture over the flour mixture and mix, without overmixing it (or else the final result will be tough); then, add the apples and mix them in. 
  5. Pour in a greased mold. If desired, put some apple pieces on top to decorate. 
  6. Bake for 30-40 minutes, depending on the mold and the oven, until when inserting a knife in the middle, it comes out clean.

This is one of these recipes that I make in bulk and then freeze for an easy lunch or dinner for another day. These sausages are fenomenal, very high protein and quite low-carb, so they make for a great dinner when combined with some cauli-rice, keto bbq sauce and salad. Hope you enjoy them!


* **Ingredients**, _makes 12 sausages_
  - 250 g vital wheat gluten
  - 300 g tofu (best to use silken, but you can use firm if you want)
  - _Optional: 1/2 cup nutritional yeast_
  - Spices: 2 tbsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp sweet paprika, 1 tsp smoked paprika, chili to taste, 1 tbsp ground mustard seeds
  - 1 tsp salt
  - Sweetener to taste (equals 1 tsp sugar)
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 3 tsp liquid smoke
  - 1 cup of water
  - 2 tbsp olive oil


* **Process**
  1. Blend the tofu, garlic, soy sauce, oliquid smoke, water and oil until smooth.
  2. Mix all the dry ingredients. 
  3. Add the wet mixture into the dry and mix well. 
  4. Knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes. 
  5. Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece in a sausage shape with some aluminum foil. 
  6. Steam for 30 minutes. 
  7. Let them cool down and keep in the fridge or freezer. When you want to eat them, just stir-fry them with some oil and enjoy!

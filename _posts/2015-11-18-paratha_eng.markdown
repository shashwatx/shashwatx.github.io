* **Ingredients**

  * Para the dough:

    * 1/4 tsp salt
    * 1/3 cup water (depends on the flour, add little at a time)

  1. Make the dough in the same way as for roti/chapati.
  2. To make the filling: mash everything together with a fork. Taste for salt.
  3. Divide the dough into four balls. 
    * With each one, form a disk (slightly thicker in the center)
    * Put about a tbsp of the filling on top of the disk
    * Seal the edges on top
    * Form the paratha with a rolling pin, flour and lots of care.
  4. Cook in a pan or tawa over medium-high heat.
  5. Once cooked, spread some butter on top while it is still warm.

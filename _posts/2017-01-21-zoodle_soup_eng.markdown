When i got Maria Emmerich's book as a christmas present from my wonderful boyfriend I marked a zillion recipes on my to-do list. The broccoli cheese noodle soup was particularly wonderful, so I adapted it with a little less cheese, using zoodles instead of broccoli, and skipping the bacon, but you can top the soup with fried bacon bits instead of pumpkin seeds if you like pork.

<ul>
  <li>200 g zoodles (3 cups)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>1 tsp fresh garlic</li>
  <li>1/2 small onion (35 g)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cream cheese (60g)</li>
  <li>2/3 cup cheddar or edam cheese (75g)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 liter of broth (or 1/2 liter of water and one bouillon cube) + 1/2 liter of water</li>
  <li>Optional: 30 g pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt 1/3 tbsp butter in a pot. Add the zoodles and cook for about two minutes with a pinch of salt. Don't overcook them. 
  2. Take the zoodles out and save for later. Add in the rest of the butter and fry the onion and garlic bout 5 minutes until it is translucent (do not burnt like i did). 
  3. Add the cream cheese, mix well over low heat, then add the liquid, cheese and black pepper.
  4. Bring to a boil. Let it boil a couple of minutes, then blend with a hand blender.
  5. Add the zoodles back inside, bring up to temperature, serve and top with the pumpkin seeds.

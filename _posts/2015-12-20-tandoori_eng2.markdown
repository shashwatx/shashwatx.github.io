Tandoori chicken with easily available spices - you have no excuse not to make it now!


* **Ingredients**

  * 2 chicken pieces, with bone
  * 2 yoghurts
  * Ginger paste - 2 tbsp
  * Garlic paste - 2 tbsp
  * 4 tsp paprika 
  * 1/2 tsp chili
  * 3 tsp coriander powder
  * 1.5 tsp cumin
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 tsp garlic powder
  * 1/2 tsp ginger powder
  * 2 tsp onion powder
  * 3/4 tsp salt (start with less and add to taste)
  * 2 tbsp lemon juice

* **Process**

  1. Make slits in the chicken.
  2. Mix the yoghurt, lemon and spices. Try the mix to adjust salt.
  3. Marinate the chicken and let sit in the fridge at least 4 hours. **_Very important to marinate properly in this case since we are using less spices; otherwise the chicken might be bland._**
  4. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
  5. Put the chicken on the griddle and a baking sheet underneath to collect any juices.
  6. Cook until dry and crunchy, at least 30 minutes.
  7. Let rest a couple of minutes before serving.

_Serve with **fresh tomato**, onion and coriander._

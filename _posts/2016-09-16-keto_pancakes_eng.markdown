These pancakes are my new favorite! They are so thick and fluffy, are fast to make in the morning, and so delicious! I hope you enjoy them as much as me! 


* **Ingredients**, _serves 1_
  * 10 g of vanilla-flavored protein powder (1/3 of a serving)
    - _I use decathlon's Soy and Oat protein powder. I know it's not strictly keto, but I like it!_
  * 1 egg
  * 1 tbsp flax meal
  * A pinch of salt
  * 2/3 tbsp of coconut oil or butter + 1/3 for cooking
  * 1/2 tbsp vinegar
  * 1/3 tsp baking soda


* **Process**
  1. Melt the coconut oil or butter. Then mix with the egg and vinegar. 
  2. In a different bowl, mix all the dry ingredients.
  3. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ones and mix.
    - _If I make it ahead of time, I mix everything except the baking soda, and then mix it in thoroughly right before cooking._
  4. Heat up a non-stick pan with oil or butter on medium-high heat. Once hot, add the batter and cook like regular pancakes: about 1-1.5 minutes on the first side until you have bubbles on the surface, then flip and cook another minute on the other side. 
  5. Serve with your favorite low-carb topping - in my case, low-carb blackberry jam <3

A very handy recipe for any low-carb vegetarians or vegans out there: 10 g protein and only 5.5 g of net carbs per pattie. And they can be frozen raw, to thaw and use for a quick simple meal!
(Warning: do not sprout the soy beans for this recipe. They develop a very weird taste!). 
You can change the spices according to your taste, to make different flavored burgers.

<ul>
    <li>150 g soy beans</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil (you can use less if you prefer)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 flax "eggs": 3 tbsp flax meal + 6 tbsp warm water</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tsp liquid smoke</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Soak the beans for 12 hours.
  2. Boil the beans for about 45 minutes, or until they are softer but still have texture (if they get too mushy, the burgers won't hold)
  3. Prepare the flax eggs and let them rest 5 minutes.
  4. Process the beans until you get a couscous texture. Then, mix with the rest of ingredients to form a dense mixture. 
  5. Divide into 6 and form the patties with your hands.
  6. Cook with a teaspoon of olive oil over medium-high heat, about 2-3 minutes per side.

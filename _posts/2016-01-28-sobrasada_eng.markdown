"Sobrasada" is a typical spanish spread made primarily of pork fat and paprika. Quite honestly, it has always been one of my soft points: I love it! So when I found out there were recipes for vegan "sobrasada" made with sundried tomatoes, I had to give it a go. 

I use two different recipes depending on what I have available at home, this one uses oats. It tastes like spicy paprika, and oregano, and olive oil... just try it already!

<ul>
  <li>50 g sundried tomatoes (NOT the ones that come in oil)</li>
  <li>20 g rolled oats (1/4 cup)</li>
  <li>1 cc paprika, sweet or spicy depending on your taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder or half a garlic clove</li>
  <li>Optional: extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp oregano</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt and some black pepper</li>
</ul>

* **Process** 

  1. Hydrate the tomatoes and oats in warm water (not boiling) for 15 minutes. 
  2. Drain very well.
  3. Process all the ingredients and let it cool down in the fridge beefore serving.
    
**Spread it on bread, make sobrasada and cheese sandwiches... whatever you like most!**

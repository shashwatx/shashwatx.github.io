"Sobrasada" is a typical spanish spread made primarily of pork fat and paprika. Quite honestly, it has always been one of my soft points: I love it! So when I found out there were recipes for vegan "sobrasada" made with sundried tomatoes, I had to give it a go. 

I use two different recipes depending on what I have available at home, this one uses oats. It tastes like spicy paprika, and oregano, and olive oil... just try it already!



* **Ingredients**
  * 50 g sundried tomatoes (NOT the ones that come in oil)
  * 20 g rolled oats (1/4 cup)
  * 1 cc paprika, sweet or spicy depending on your taste
  * 1/2 tsp garlic powder or half a garlic clove
  * _Optional: extra virgin olive oil_
  * 1/4 tsp oregano
  * A pinch of salt and some black pepper


* **Process** 

  1. Hydrate the tomatoes and oats in warm water (not boiling) for 15 minutes.

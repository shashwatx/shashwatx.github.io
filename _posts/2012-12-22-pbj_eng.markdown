<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup + 1/4 flour (I use whole wheat)</li>
  <li>1/8 cup sugar (or more to taste)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp vanilla sugar</li>
  <li>1.5-2 tbsp unsweetened peanut butter</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
  <li>2 tsp strawberry jam</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp corn starch</li>
  <li>1-3 tbsp milk or water</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 tsp vanilla and/or 1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
 </ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, sugar and vanilla sugar.
  2. Add the peanut butter and mix thoroughly.
  3. Add 1 tbsp milk or water and mix. Add liquid a little at a time.
  4. In a bowl, put the jam and heat it up in the microwave for 5-10 seconds. Once it's runny, mix with the cornstarch.
  5. Form the cookies and lay on parchment paper; it should form 10-12 cookies.
     - _Watch the video for specifics on how to give them the shape._
  6. Cook in the microwave for about 90 (time depends on the microwave so be careful!)
  7. Take out of the microwave and gently spoon a little bit of jam mixture into the central hole. 
  8. Microwave for further 20 seconds approximately. 
    * If overcooked, they get tough and dry! 

Let them rest at least 15 minutes (better 30 or 60) for best results.

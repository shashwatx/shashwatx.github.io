This is the indian version of scrambled tofu: crumbled paneer with vegetables and spices. A very filling meal full of protein that takes 10 minutes from start to finish. A must try!

<ul>
  <li>250 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>50 g onion (1/2 medium), chopped</li>
  <li>1 small tomato (100g), chopped</li>
  <li>Other vegetables to taste (like green peas), optional</li>
  <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp whole cumin</li>
  <li>Red chili powder to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp garam masala or more to taste</li> 
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>  
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, if the crumbled paneer is too dry, add a little bit of warm water to rehydrate it.
  2. Melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds until they start popping. Then, add the onion with some salt and cook for 5 minutes until they are brown.
  3. Once the onion is cooked, add the ginger and garlic. Cook for a minute. 
  4. Add the tomatoes and salt. Cook for two minutes until they the tomatoes are soft, then add the other spices. Mix well. 
  5. Add the paneer (drained if you were soaking it). Cook for 30-60 seconds. Add the kasuri methi if you are using it.
  6. Garnish with lemon juice and coriander.

I know. The idea of cheeseless cheesecake sounds awful. 

But this recipe is actually very good. Way healthier than regular cheesecake, and with a lot of flavor.

It is actually a lemon cheesecake, with a filling that uses only two ingredients: lemon jello (powdered, enough for 500 nL of water) and coconut milk. This way, it is just as creamy as a regular cheesecake, but without the cholesterol, and suitable for lactose-intolerant people.

Apart from that, instead of using the popular graham crackers+butter crust, I used oats with coconut oil (that could be subbed for butter, of course); this way, it has less sugar and less fat.

With the proportions I give you, the final result is a pretty thin cake, because my favourite part is the base. But if you prefer, you can double the filling to have a thicker cake.

* **Ingredients**
  * 1 package of lemon jello (enough for 500 mL water)
  * 400 mL coconut milk
  * 1 cup (250 mL) rolled oats
  * 2-3 tbsp sugar
  * 2-3 tbsp coconut oil


* **Process**
  1. In a pan without oil over medium heat, toast the oats with the sugar for about 5 minutes, until the oats are a bit golden and the sugar starts caramelizing a bit. After that, add the coconut oil along with 1/4 cup of water and mix well; you should end up with a sort of dough that is a bit dry but that can be shaped.
  2. Put the mixture in the cake mold you will use (I like to cover mine in parchment paper so it doesn't stick), make it even and then put in the freezer to firm up for 15-30 minutes. 
  3. In a pan or casserole, put half of the coconut milk to boil; once it does, turn off the stove and add the jello powder. Mix well to dissolve. Then, add the rest of the coconut milk and mix.
  4. Last, take out the base from the freezer and, very carefully, pour the coconut filling on top of it. Then, put it in the fridge for 2-3 hours until it sets, and it's done!

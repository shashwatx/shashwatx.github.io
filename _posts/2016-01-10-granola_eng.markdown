* **Ingredients**
  * 1 cup oats. _I prefer traditional oats, not rolled, for this recipe._
  * 1/2 cup walnuts or other nuts, raw and chopped.
  * 2 tbsp coconut oil or butter
  * 2-3 tbsp honey or maple syrup _(depending on your sweet tooth)_
  * _Optional: 1/4 tsp cinnamon._
  * Pinch of salt
  * _Other ingredients can be added once it's cold: chocolate chips (1/8 cup), raisins, dried cranberries..._


* **Process**
  1. Put the oats and nuts on a skillet with no oil over medium heat and toast for 5-7 minutes. 
  2. Add the rest of ingredients and mix. Cook for a few more minutes until all the ingredients are properly coated. 
  3. Take off the stove and let cool down on a plate. 
  4. Store in a sealed container.

Enjoy with milk, yoghurt, cottage cheese, applesauce...

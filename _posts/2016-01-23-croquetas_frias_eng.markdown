This is a recipe with which my mom and I won the First Annual Masterchef Contest in my family... I guess the cooking thing runs in the blood!
These are somewhat of a mix between croquetas, hummus and "sobrasada", a spanish spicy spread. I know it sounds odd, but it has a great flavour and it takes very little time to put together!
Plus, they are completely vegan :)



* **Ingredients**
  * 400 g cooked chickpeas, drained (I use canned)
  * 40-50 g sundried tomato
  * 1/2 tsp oregano
  * 1 tbsp paprika - you can combine sweet and spicy to taste
  * Salt, black pepper, extra virgin olive oil: to taste
  * 1/2-1 cloves of garlic (to taste)
  * Breadcrumbs

* **Process**
  1. Soak the tomatoes in warm water for about 15 -30 minutes. 
  2. Process the chickpeas, spices, drained tomatoes, salt, garlic and oil until you get a smooth paste that is quite dense and you can shape with your hands.
  3. Let the mixture cool down in the fridge; meanwhile, brown the breadcrumbs on a pan over low heat.
  4. In a plate, combine the breadcrumbs with salt and pepper; then, form the "croquetas" with your hands by shaping them with the chickpea mixture, coat them with the breadcrumbs and enjoy.

I like them better at room temperature. They last a couple of days in the fridge if you have leftovers!

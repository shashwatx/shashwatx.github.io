These are such a fun way to get more veggies in. Even my broccoli-hating family loved these!


<ul>
  <li>250 g broccoli</li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese (45 g)</li>
  <li>2 heaping tbsp coconut flour (24g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>A good pinch of salt and some black pepper</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of water (or more if needed)</li>
  <li><i>Optional: 1/2 serving of neutral flavor protein powder (equals 15 g protein)</i></li>
  <li><i>Optional, for frosting: 4 tbsp butter, 6 tbsp cream cheese (180g)</i></li>
</ul>

* **Process** 
  1. Steam the broccoli just until it is tender (don't overcook so it doesn't lose the bright green color). You can do this in the microwave. 
  2. Pur√©e the broccoli. 
  3. Add all the other ingredients except for the ones for the frosting. 
  4. Divide into 9 muffin molds. 
  5. Cook in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes, OR microwave for 4 minutes, or until the center has set. 
  6. _Optional: whip the butter and cream cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper until you form a buttercream; use it to frost the muffins._

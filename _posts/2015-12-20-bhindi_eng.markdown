* **Ingredients**, _serves 3_
  * 250 g bhindi (Okra), chopped
  * One onion, finely chopped
  * _Optional: 2 green chilies, deseeded_
  * 2 tomatoes, chopped
  * 1 tsp ginger paste
  * 1 tsp garlic paste
  * 1 tsp coriander powder
  * _Optional: 1/4 tsp chili powder_
  * 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  * 1/2 tsp garam masala
  * 1/2 tsp dry mango powder (amchur)
     - _If non available, can be subbed for lemon juice, to be added in the end._
  * Salt, to taste
  * _Optional, but a very good addition: dry fenugreek leaves_


* **Process**
  1. In a pan over medium high heat, put one tbsp of vegetable oil with the green chillies. 
  2. Once they start to splatter a bit, add the onion with some salt and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. 
  3. At this point, add the garlic and ginger paste and cook stirring for 1 minute. 
  4. Add the spices (except the fenugreek leaves) and cook for further 30 seconds. 
     - _If the pan looks dry, add a splash of water to avoid the spices from burning._
  5. Add the tomatoes with salt and cook for 5-10 minutes until they are broken down. 
  6. Add the raw, chopped bhindi with some salt, mix and then put some water, cover and let them boil. 
  7. Boil for about 15 minutes on medium-low heat, covered and stirring occasionally, until the bhindi is cooked through. 
     - _It is important to taste a piece of bhindi to make sure there is no "slimy" raw texture left before serving._
  8. Turn off the heat and sprinkle the fenugreek leaves, crushing them between your fingers first to release the aroma. 

Serve with rice. Yummy!

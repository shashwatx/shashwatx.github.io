This is an italian dish perfect for carnivores, but it also works wonderfully using seitan instead of chicken. The final result is a slightly thick sauce, acidic from the lemon and capers, and with smooth buttery texture... Perfect with salad, rice or cauli-rice! 

If you follow a ketogenic diet, do not hesitate on adding more butter - the more, the better :D 

* **Ingredients**, _serves 6_
  * 750 g chicken breast fillets, or 6 seitan steaks
    - _If you are using seitan, the final carb count will be higher_
  * 1/3 medium onion (60g), sliced finely
  * 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  * 2 tbsp capers
  * 3 tbsp butter
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * Salt, black pepper
  * One chicken stock cube (optional)
  * 1/2 cup (125 mL) white wine
  * 1/4 cup (60 mL) lemon juice
  * The zest of half a lemon
  * Abour 1/4 cup of chopped parsley
  * 1 tbsp flax meal


* **Process**
  1. In a pan, brown the chicken (with some salt) using a bit of the butter over medium-high. Leave the browned pieces on the side for later. 
  2. Add the rest of butter and oil in the pan and fry the onion and garlic over medium-low for 10-15 minutes, until it's brown and soft. 
  3. Add the meat back in and pour the wine. Let it simmer about 5 minutes for the alcohol to evaporate. Mix well.
  4. After, add the capers, some black pepper and half the parsley. Mix well. 
  5. Finally, add the flax (to thicken the sauce) and the lemon juice. Turn off the stove and garnish with the rest of the parsley and some lemon slices.

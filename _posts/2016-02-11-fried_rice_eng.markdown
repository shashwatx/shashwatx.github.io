Another great way to use the cauliflower "rice": make chinese fried rice! It was a huge hit with my guests :)
 


* **Ingredients**, _serves 4-5_
  * 1 processed cauliflower, like you can see [here](http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice)
  * 200-300 g shrimp (I buy frozen raw shrimp and thaw )
  * 150 g boiled green peas (mine were canned) 
  * 2 cubed carrots
  * 2-3 tbsp soy sauce
  * 1/2 tsp ginger paste
  * 1/2 tsp garlic paste (1-2 cloves)
  * Salt, black pepper
  * Spring onion to garnish


* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil, add the garlic and ginger. After cooking for a minute, add the carrots with a bit of salt and pepper. 
  2. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the carrot is slightly soft. Turn up the heat and add the shrimp. 
  3. Cook the shrimp for a couple of minutes and then add the green peas. Cook for one minute.
  4. Add the processed cauliflower, soy sauce, stir very well and cook for a couple of minutes until the cauliflower is soft. Check salt and pepper. 
  5. Garnish with spring onion.

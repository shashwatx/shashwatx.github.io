Ready in 10 minutes !

* **Ingredients**, _serves one_
  * 1 medium zucchini, spiralized
  * ½ clove of garlic, minced
  * 1 ripe tomato
  * _Optional: a small piece of roasted red pepper._
  * Small drained can of tuna
  * Oregano, salt, pepper
  * Parmesan or feta cheese


* **Process**
  1. Puree the raw tomato with some salt and black pepper, and the roasted pepper if using. 
  2. In a pan, put the garlic very finely minced with about a teaspoon of oil over médium heat. When the garlic starts to turn golden, add the zucchini and cook with salt and pepper for about 2 minutes, until it softens a Little bit. 
   - _If it gets overcooked, the zucchini might release water; if this happens, you should take them out of the pan with a fork or something similar to leave the liquid behind._
  3. Serve the zoodles with the tomato sauce, tuna, oregano, cheese and a some good quality olive oil on top. 


I like to take this in a lunch box, putting the zoodles in a box and the rest of ingredients in a small jar, so I can warm up the zoodles over there, mix everything up, and eat!

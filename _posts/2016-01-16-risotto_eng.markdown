* **Ingredients**, _serves 3_
  * 1 tbsp oil
  * 150-200 g butternut squash, cubed (about 2 cups)
  * 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
  * 1 onion, finely chopped
  * 1/2 tsp oregano
  * 1/4 cup white wine
  * 2 cups of chicken stock (should be hot when you use it)
  * Cooked chicken breast (optional)
  * 1/2 cup rice
  * Small stick of cinnamon
  * Peel of 1/4 lemon 
  * Salt (very little since the stock is already salty), black pepper
  * Parmesan cheese

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick skillet, warm up the oil and then add the vegetables with a pinch of salt. 
  2. Cook on medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the onion is tender and the butternut starts to be softer. 
  3. Add the rice to the skillet and cinnamon, oregano and lemon peel _(and the chicken if using it)_, and cook stirring for about 2 minutes. 
  4. Add the white rice  and cook until the rice has absorbed all the wine.
  5. Now, add the chicken stock a little at a time (1/4-1/2 cup each time), while stirring on low heat continuously, and waiting until the liquid is absorbed to add some more (same technique as for any risotto).
   - _As I do this, I like to smash the butternut with the back of the wooden spoon._
  6. Once the rice is cooked through (and at this point the butternut should be tender as well), turn off the stove and mix in some grated parmesan. 
   - _The final texture of the risotto should be a little bit fluid, not dry._
   - _If you want to, you could add some butter in the end as well for some extra creamyness._ 

A very tasty risotto, with all the lemony and cheesy goodness!

My boyfriend (who so lovingly codes everything for my website, and is the one responsible for the gorgeous look it has!) loves sausages for breakfast. It is one of the few things that I don't like him eating, since it is very fatty, processed, unhealthy meat. The only other things he would like for breakfast usually involve a long time of cooking, so I have been trying to come up with a savory breakfast for him that does not include chicken and can be cooked fast in the morning.

So, these sausages came to be: meaty, spicy sausages, that take a little bit of prepping time but that can last in the fridge (or freezer) for a while, making for an easy breakfast, but also awesome in pizzas or sandwiches. You will be gladly surprised when you try it! In fact, I like these better than traditional sausages :)

* **Ingredients** _Measurement for 1 cup: 250 mL_
  - 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas or white beans, mashed with a fork
  - Spices: 1 tsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp crushed fennel seeds (the recipe I used in the beginning suggested 1 tsp of ground fennel seed instead, but I rather prefer the crushed seed version), 1 tsp spicy paprika, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional, but adds great flavor!)
  - 1 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 cup of vegetable broth (I use about 1.5 tbsp of stock powder and then add water)
  - 1+1/4 cups of vital wheat gluten
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce

* **Process**
  1. Firstly, prepare your water in the steamer.
  2. Mix in a bowl the nutritional yeast and the wheat gluten. In a different bowl, mix all the other ingredients. 
  3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix thoroughly. You will end up with an elastic ball that forms "threads" (those are your proteins!). 
  4. Make the shape you want: either form small sausages or one big loaf. Cover each sausage/loaf with cheese cloth.
   - _If you don't have any cheese cloth, I recommend using sterile gauze pads (If you have a doctor in the family, you will probably have some around the house!)_
  5. Place on your steamer and steam about 35 minutes if making small sausages, or about 50 min if making one big loaf. The cooking time depends a lot on the size of your sausages, so it can vary a lot. If in doubt, just cut it in half and check that the center has changed its texture, losing that "thready" property it had when raw.
  6. Eat immediately or save for later.

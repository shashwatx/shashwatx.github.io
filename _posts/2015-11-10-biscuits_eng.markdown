<ul>
  <li>1/3 cup + 1/4 flour</li>
  <li>1/4 cup sugar (or less to taste)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/2-1 tbsp vegetal or coconut oil</li>
  <li>2 tbsp dissecated coconut</li>
  <li>1-3 tbsp coconut milk (or regular milk)</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/2 tsp vanilla and/or 1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, sugar and coconur.
  2. Add the oil and mix thoroughly with a spoon.
  3. Add 1 tbsp coconut milk (and vanilla extract if using) and mix. Add milk a little at a time.
  4. Form the biscuits and lay on parchment paper (makes 10 small or 5 big biscuits).
  5. _Optional, but should be done: eat everything left behind in the bowl and spoon!_ :)
  6. Cook in the microwave for about 90-120 seconds (time depends on the microwave so be careful!)
     - In the beggining the might look undercooked; let them sit for 10 minutes before eating. 
     - If overcooked, they get tough and dry! 

The result: spongy and sweet cookies. _**Delicious!**_

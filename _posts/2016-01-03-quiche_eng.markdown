* **Ingredients**
  * 1 puff pastry sheet (for the base)
  * 400 g of frozen spinach
  * 100-150 g goat cheese. _You can save a couple of slices to put at the end._
  * 4 eggs
  * 5 tbsp milk 
  * Salt, black pepper

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius. 
  2. Cook the spinach according to package (in my case, in the microwave) and drain all the water carefully.
  3. Mix the eggs with salt and pepper, then add the milk and mix. 
  4. Add in the spinach to the egg mixture. 
  5. Cut the cheese in small pieces and add to the previous mixture. 
   - _You can save a few cheese slices to put at the top of the quiche in the end._
  6. Layer the puff pastry sheet on your pie dish. 
  7. Pour the quiche mixture over the pastry. 
   - _At this point you can put on top the slices of cheese, to get a more colourful result._
  8. Cook on the low third of the oven for about 25 minutes, or until the center is set, but still slightly moist. 
   - _If it gets too toasted on top, cover with aluminum foil and put it back in the oven._

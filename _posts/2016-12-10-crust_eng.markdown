This crust, based on the recipe from [healthfulpursuit](http://www.healthfulpursuit.com), takes a while to make, but is gluten-free, egg-free, vegan, low carb, and has a great flavor! 


<ul>
  <li>1 + 1/4 cups ground flax</li>
  <li>1/4 sunflower seeds, ground</li>
  <li>80-100 g onion (one small)</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>Other ingredients to taste, for example one clove of garlic (minced)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Warm up the oven to 110C.
  2. Blend the onion with the oil and vinegar. 
  3. In a separate bowl mix the other ingredients, then add the onion mixture. You should get a thick paste, dry but not crumbly. If it crumbles, add some water.
  4. Grease your quiche mold very well (or even better, put a circle of parchment paper in the bottom) and put the mixture inside. Then use a spoon or your hands to form the crust. Water your hands to smooth it out.
  5. Bake for 90 minutes until it is dry and crunchy. Then, take it out and add the filling of choice,

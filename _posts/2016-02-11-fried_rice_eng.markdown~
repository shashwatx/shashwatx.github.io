Another great way to use the cauliflower "rice": make chinese fried rice! It was a huge hit with my guests :)
 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup processed cauliflower or 3 cups (360g) of <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice">cauliflower rice</a></li>
  <li>180g g shrimp (I buy frozen raw shrimp and thaw)</li>
  <li>40 g boiled green peas (mine were canned)</li>
  <li>1/2 carrot, cubed (30g)</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3 tbsp coconut oil (or 2 of coconut oil and 1 of sesame oil)</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste (1-2 cloves)</li>
  <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
  <li>3 tbsp (20g) Spring onion to garnish</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a pan with a tablespoon of oil, add the garlic and ginger. After cooking for a minute, add the carrots with a bit of salt and pepper. 
  2. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the carrot is slightly soft. Turn up the heat and add the shrimp. 
  3. Cook the shrimp for a couple of minutes and then add the green peas. Cook for one minute.
  4. Add the processed cauliflower, soy sauce, stir very well and cook for a couple of minutes until the cauliflower is soft. 
  5. Make a small space in the pan and crack the eggs on it; cook them mixing constantly, then incorporating them onto the rice. Check salt and pepper. 
  6. Garnish with spring onion.

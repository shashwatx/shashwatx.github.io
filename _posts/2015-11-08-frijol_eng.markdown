* **Ingredients**, _for 5 burguers_
  * 500 g cooked red kidney beans
  * 2 tbsp besan (chickpea flour) - _can be subbed for oat flour or breadcrumbs_
  * 2 tsp cumin
  * 2 tsp paprika
  * 1 tsp oregano
  * 2 tsp onion powder
  * 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  * 1/4-1/2 tsp salt (start with less and adjust to taste)
  * 1/2 tsp black pepper
  * 1/4-1/2 tsp chili
  * _Optional: a bit of Worcestershire sauce_
  * 2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander 
  * _Optional: breadcrumbs with salt to coat the burguers_
 
* **Process**
  1. With a fork, mash the beans to get a paste that still has some texture. 
  2. Add the rest of ingredients. 
  3. Form the “burguers” using your wet hands. 
     - _Optional: coat with breadcrubs, which makes the forming easier._ 
  4. Cook in an oiled pan over medium-high heat, not moving it in the first few minutes.


Serve with **avocado**, chipotle sauce, or whatever you like!

I have always enjoyed  meat-stuffed cabbage rolls. But I am trying to go vegetarian, so substituting the ground meat for lentils seemed like a good idea. 

The biggest problem I have had with this recipe was making the stuffed rolls using the cabbage leaves... It takes some practice, I guess. But even if the final result is a bit ugly, it is equally delicious!

I won't lie: this recipe does require some time. Because rolling takes a while. But the final result is very flavourful, and the leftovers are just as good, or even better!

I added quite a bit of spices to give it a Middle Eastern vibe, with a strong cinnamon aroma. But of couse you can adapt them to your taste.


* **Ingredients**, _serves 4_
  * 500 g cooked brown lentils (I used canned lentils)
  * 1 cup cooked rice or any other grain, like quinoa
  * _Optional: 1/2 cup raisins_
  * 1/2 cup fresh parsley or coriander
  * 3 medium-sized onions, chopped
  * 2 tablespoons of olive oil
  * 1 bay leaf
  * 2 generous tablespoons of tomato paste
  * Spices: 1 tsp powdered cumin, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp paprika, chili powder to taste (I used about 1/4-1/2 tsp), 3 tsp cinnamon powder 
  * One cabbage (you will actually only use half, but will need the whole to use the big leaves)
  * For the sauce: you can use a basic tomato sauce with garlic and onion (I used store-bought pasta sauce), to which we will add 6-8 whole cloves while it boils with the rolls.


* **Process**
  1. In a pan, put the oil with 3 tbsp of water, the bay leaf and the onion. Cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes until it is caramelized and broken down.
   - _You can add 1/4 tsp baking soda to make it caramelise faster._
  2. Add the spices, cook for a minute, then add the tomato paste, lentils and salt. Cook for some minutes until the final mixture is paste-like but not too dry. Afterwards, turn off the fire and add the rice, raisins and parsley or coriander.
  3. Boil the whole cabbage with a lot of water for about 20 minutes or until the leaves are soft enough to separate them from the core. Let them cool down.
  4. Once the leaves are cool, separate them and trim the stem lenghtwise on the outer part, to make it thinner. Do not cut the stem all the way through: that was my mistake, and I ended up having a very weirdly-shaped cabbage leaf that was very difficult to use for rolling!
  5. Form your wraps: put 2-3 tbsp of the mixture inside of the leaf, fold the part with the stem over the filling, than fold the sides and finish rolling. This requires some practice, at least in my case!
  6. In a big casserole with some oil or some tomato sauce on the base (to prevent sticking), put all your rolls in a single layer (Its okay if they pile a little bit). Afterwards, pour the sauce on top, with some water to avoid it being too thick, and with the whole cloves. 
  7. Cook on low-medium heat for about 40 minutes; in this time the cloves will infuse the sauce.
  8. Take off the heat once the cabbage leaves are tender. 
  9. Serve hot with bread!

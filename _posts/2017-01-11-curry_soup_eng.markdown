This soup takes about 20 minutes to put together, is loaded with protein and healthy fats, and amazingly tasty! 

If you are in a hurry you can cut the cooking time of the tofu and the onions by half, but I really love how the tofu gets a little bit crunchy on the outside. 

<ul>
  <li>250 g firm tofu</li>
  <li>One small red onion (70g), coarsly chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ginger paste or 1/2 inch ginger chopped</li>
  <li>1 medium zucchini (200g) spiralized or two broccoli stalks (about 140g) spiralized (omit for fewer carbs)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic paste or one big garlic clove chopped</li>
  <li>100 g mushrooms, sliced</li>
  <li>2/3 cup coconut milk</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
  <li>One bouillon cube</li>
  <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. In a non stick pot, put half the oil and add the onion, garlic and ginger. Cook ovver medium-low heat with a pinch of salt for about 15-20 minutes. 
  2. At the same time, in a non stick pan, add the other half of the oil, then cook the cubed tofu over high heat until it is very brown and dry, about 15 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, cook for about 5 minutes. Lastly, add the spiralized zucchini and cook for a minute.
  3. Once the onion is very soft, add the curry powder, coconut milk, water, chili and bouillon cube. Bring to a boil, then use blend with a hand mixer. 
  4. Add the tofu, mushrooms and zoodles. Let it all boil together for 1-2 minutes.
  5. Serve with coriander.

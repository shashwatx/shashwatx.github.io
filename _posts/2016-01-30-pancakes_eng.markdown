I love pancakes (who doesn't!?). But it's so annoying that it always needs so many ingredients and you end up making batter for a lot of people... 

So, I came up with this simple one-serving recipe for pancakes, using oats that i adoooore, as well as sweet potato puree that I had in the fridge; however, I am pretty sure that pumpkin purere or even applesauce would work. Let me know if you try!


* **Ingredients**, _serves 1_
  * 1/2 cup rolled oats
  * 1/4 cup sweet potato puree
  * 1 egg
  * _Optional: 1-2 tsp sugar_
  * _Optional: 1/4 tsp cinnamon_
  * _Optional: 1/4 tsp baking powder_

* **Process**

  1. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. 
  2. Add water a little bit at a time until you get a batter of pancake consistency. I usually need a little bit over 1/4 cup water. 
  3. Let it rest for about 5 minutes. 
  4. Put a pan with some butter or oil over medium high heat. Check your pancake batter; if it's thicker than before (oats absorbed some of the water), add a little bit more water. 
  5. Make your pancakes (3-4 minutes on one side until there are some bubbles and it's almost set; then, one minute on the other side). 
  6. Eat!

So fluffy and moist! :)

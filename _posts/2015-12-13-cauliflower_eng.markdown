This can be used to substitute couscous or rice as a sidedish, as well as in some recipes. I usually either make it in the microwave with some salt, or stir fry it with a bit of oil. I will post some of the things I like to make, but would love to hear your ideas!

<ul>
  <li>1 cauliflower, fresh, cut into florets, clean and dry</li>
</ul>

* If using a **foodprocessor**: rinse the cauliflower florets and, once dry, introduce in the processor (2-3 batches per cauliflower) and process until you get a rice or couscous consistency, abouy 30-60 seconds. 
* If using a **mixer**: rinse the cauliflower and introduce in batches in the standing mixer with some water and mix; once acquired the desired texture, drain. 
* If using a **grater**: rince the cauliflower properly and grate patiently.

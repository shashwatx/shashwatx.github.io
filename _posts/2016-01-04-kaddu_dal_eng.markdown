* **Ingredients**
  * 1 cup masoor dal - better if soaked for an hour
  * 2 cups butternut squash or pumpkin, cubed: about 150-200 g
  * _Optional: 2 dried chillies or 2 green fresh chillies_
  * 1 tsp mustard seeds
  * 1 tsp cumin seeds
  * _Optional: Pinch asafoetida_
  * 1/2 tbsp ginger paste, 1/2 tbsp garlic paste
  * 1/2 tsp turmeric
  * 1/2 tsp garam masala
  * 1 tsp powdered cumin
  * 1 tsp powdered coriander 
  * 1/4 tsp red chili powder or to taste
  * Salt and black pepper to taste
  * Lemon juice and coriander for garnishing

* **Process**
  1. In a pot, put about 2.5 cups of water with the dal, pumpkin and 1/4 tsp of the turmeric. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for about 25-40 min (depending on whether the dal was soaked or not and on how mushy you like the dal).
  2. When the dal has about 10 minutes left to finish, in a small pan over medium heat put a tablespoon of vegetable oil and add the whole chillies, mustard and whole cumin seeds, When they crack, add the garlic and ginger; cook for 2 minutes and then rest of spices. Cook on low heat for further 1 minute without burning.
  3. Add the spice mixture (_tadka_) to the dal and let boil together a couple of minutes. Add salt and pepper and taste to adjust. 
  4. Once cooked, turn off the heat, add lemon juice (about one tablespoon) and serve with fresh coriander.

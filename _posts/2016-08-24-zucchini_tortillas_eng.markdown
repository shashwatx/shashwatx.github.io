Another low-carb recipe that doesn't require many ingredients and is great for when you buy zucchini in bulk (like me!). 

These are soft, slightly sweet tortillas, that are great freshly made to make fajitas, tacos or quesadillas, and they hold pretty good in the fridge for 2-3 days - just heat them up for a few seconds and use!


* **Ingredients**, _for 6 tortillas_
  * 500 g zucchini, grated (2,5 medium zucchini)
  * 3 tbsp (heaping) coconut flour
  * 1 egg
  * 1/2 tbsp pesto (optional, you can add more or omit)
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * _Optional: shredded cheese; mine was kind of high in carbs so I only used 20g, and it can probably be omitted_

* **Process**
  1. Turn on the oven to 180C to preheat.
  2. Squeeze that grated zucchini, and then squeeze some more. You should end up with about 1 cup of zucchini. You can keep the liquid for cooking instead of water.
  3. Mix all the ingredients until you form a paste.
  4. Divide it into six balls, then put them onto a non-stick tray or parchment paper. Using your hands, shape them into tortilllas, about 2-3 mm thick.
  5. Cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are slightly dry, but are still soft. 
  6. Optional: if you want to make hard taco shells, put the tortillas hanging on the wire rack of the oven and cook them on low heat so they get dry and crispy.

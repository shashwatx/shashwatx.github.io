A great recipe for all those vegan ketoers, or anyone who cannot eat eggs but still wants to eat some french amazingness. You can adapt this basic recipe to your taste, changing the vegetables and/or adding other ingredients, such as cheese or meat! 


* **Ingredients**, _serves 5_
  - 1 [low-carb crust](http://maria.recipes/crust)
  - 1,5 cups of chopped zucchini (180-200 g, one medium)
  - One leek (80g)
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 400 g firm tofu
  - 3-4 tbsp water
  - 1/4 tsp turmeric
  - Black pepper to taste
  - _Optional: 3 tbsp nutritional yeast_


* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
  2. Use the oil to fry your vegetables. 
    - _I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to my vegetables to get some umami, as I didn't have nutritional yeast!_
  3. Blend the tofu with the water, turmeric, salt and pepper. You should get a dense batter.
  4. Add the cooked vegetables to the tofu mixture, then spoon over your crust.
  5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is set. Let it cool for 5 minutes before cutting into it.

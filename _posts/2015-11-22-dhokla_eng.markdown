This is a very popular snack from Gujrat: a savory spongecake made with chickpeas.

<ul>
  <li>1 cup chana dal / chickpeas - soaked overnight</li>
  <li>3 tbsp yogurt (best if left overnight outside of the fridge so it is more sour)</li>
  <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 tbsp green chili-ginger paste or 2 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 cup water _start with half, then add slowly</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/8 tsp turmeric (but if you use too much, the dhokla might end up pink!)</li>
  <li>1'5 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>For the tadka: 1 tbsp oil, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 1 tsp sesame seeds , red chili to taste, Opcional:asafoetida, 2 tbsp water, 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice , Optional: 4 seedless green chillies cut lenghtwise, curry leaves</li>
  <li>To serve: 1 tbsp coconut (better if fresh), fresh coriander.</li>
</ul>

* **Process**

1. Drain the soaked chickpeas, put in a food processor, add half a cup of water and the yogurt and process until you have a thick but smooth batter. Add water (a little at a time) if necessary. Then, let the batter outside in a warm place for 5-6 hours (you should see some bubbles appear).
2. Add the lemon, salat, ginger and turmeric to the fermented mixture. Mix.
3. Grease the mold you will be using (one big round one or two small square ones).
4. Add the baking soda (from now on you have to be fast as the reaction has already started), mix VERY well and pour on a mold.
5. Microwave for 4 minutes (I used two different molds and microwaved them separately) until set, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Original version: steam for about 10-15 minutes
6. Meanwhile, prepare the tadka: first fry the mustard seeds in the oil; when they start to pop add the sesame, take off the stove, add the asafoetida, let it cool down, then add the other ingredients.
7. Once it has set, pout the tadka over the top with a spoon so it is well distributed.
8. To finish, sprinkle the coconut and coriander over the top.

* Serve in squares with your favorite chutney (mint, tamarind or green chutney)

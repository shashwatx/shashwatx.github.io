Paneer is indian cottage cheese, one of the basic protein sources for vegetarian curries. You can use it in blocks in tikka or gravies, or you can crumble it for egg-free hash browns or bhurji. 

The nutritional info may not be 100% accurate as I estimated using packaged paneer. The more it is drained, the lower carb it will be.

<ul>
  <li>2 L (8 cups) whole fat milk</li>
  <li>1/4 cup lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy bottom saucepan.
  2. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice, stirring constantly until it curdles and the whey has separated completely.
  3. Using a very fine sieve or a cheese cloth, separate the curds from the whey. You can keep the whey for something different (it has some protein, but also carbs, so not keto-friendly!). 
  4. Drain the curd well and use it fresh, or put it with some weight on top to form a firm block.

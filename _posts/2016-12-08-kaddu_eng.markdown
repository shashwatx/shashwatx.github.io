It had been so long since I published any indian food! This is one of my favorite veg curries. It is sweet with a slightly acid touch thanks to the mango powder (that can be substituted for lemon), and is awesome with some dal and rice or roti.


<ul>
  <li>500 g pumpkin or butternut squash</li>
  <li>Dried red chili (1-2)</li>
  <li>100 g onion</li>
  <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp asafoetida (can be subbed for 1/2 tsp garlic paste, that would be used with the ginger)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>Fresh coriander, to serve</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil (mustard or coconut)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mango powder (amchoor) or 1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  <li>Stevia or sweetener to taste (equivalent to 1 tsp sugar)</li>
</ul>


* **Process**
  1. Heat up the oil. Fry the fenugreek seeds, chili and asafoetida for 2 minutes (don't burn them!!!).
  2. Add the ginger. Cook for 1 minute, then add the onion and salt. Cook on slow heat for about 10 minutes, until it is brown and soft. 
  3. Add the pumpkin and spices (except amchoor) and some more salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring. Then, pour 1/4 cup water and cover.
  4. Cook on low heat. Once the pumpkin is soft, add the rest of the ingredients, mix and serve.

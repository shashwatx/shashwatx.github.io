A simple recipe for a low-carb, lactovegetarian breakfast, for a good boost of fiber in the morning. 

<ul>
  <li>100 g paneer, crumbled</li>
  <li>1 flax egg: 1 tbsp flax meal + 3 tbsp warm water</li>
  <li>1 cup (70g) shredded cabbage</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped green onions</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. First, prepare your flax egg and let it sit for a couple of minutes. 
  2. Add the paneer to the flax egg and mix until you have a sticky paste. You can add a bit of water if needed. 
  3. Add salt, pepper and the vegetables and mix. Then divide into three. 
  4. Put 1/3 tbsp coconut oil in a pan and use it to fry one of the patties, about 3 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes after flipping. 
  5. Proceed with the other two parts of the mixture and serve.

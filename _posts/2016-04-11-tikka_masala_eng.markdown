Chicken Tikka Masala (that can also be made with paneer or tofu to keep it vegetarian) is one of the most typical dishes in indian restaurants. It has a thick onion and tomato sauce, spicy with a sweet touch, that is always a hit. 

On top of that, it is easier to make than it seems. It doesn't require many ingredients, and it always comes out great. Try it!



<ul>
  <li>700 g chicken or paneer tikka</li> 
  <li>4 peeled tomatoes (450 g or 3 cups)</li>
  <li>1 chopped medium onion (110g)</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped, or 1 tsp garlic paste</li>
  <li>2'5 cm minced ginger or 1.5 tsp ginger paste <i>(use 2/3 of the amount if making paneer or tofu tikka masala)</i></li>
  <li>Stevia to taste (equivalent to 2 tbsp brown sugar)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp chili or to taste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp oil or ghee</li>
  <li>Optional: 4 tbsp heavy cream (or yoghurt). <i>(You can substitute it for coconut milk if you want a vegan Tikka Masala.)</i></li> 
</ul>

  1. Heat up the oil and fry the onions for 5 min.

This is my favorite low-carb bread. It has a spongy texture, great for dipping, and makes great toasts and sandwiches :) 


<ul>
  <li>3,5 tbsp psyllium husk powder (28g) + 3/4 cup water</li>
  <li>6 eggs (or 2 eggs + 8 egg whites)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
  <li>1 cup coconut flour (120g)</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>2/3 tsp baking soda</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
  2. Mix the psyllium husk and water and let it sit for 5 minutes. 
  3. Blend the previous mixture with the eggs and oil until very smooth.
  4. Add the other ingredients and blend. The mixture should be quite thick.
  5. Pour into a loaf pan and shape. 
  6. Bake for 60-75 minutes. Let it cool down in a rack before you cut into it.

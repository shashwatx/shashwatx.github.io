I love zucchini (it's probably obvious since I use it in half of my recipes!). And ever since I made my first Zucchini bread, I keep looking for excuses to use it for my sweet recipes...

So, this was created. It is a great way to have a filling, delicious and healthy breakfast, and it can be prepared the night before so you can just make them in a pan and enjoy them in the morning!

* **Ingredients**, _serves one_
  * 1/2 cup rolled oats
  * 1/3 cup shredded, raw zucchini
  * 1 egg
  * 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder or vanilla extract
  * 1/2-2 tsp of sugar (to taste, and depending on what you top the pancakes with!) 
  * 1/4 tsp baking powder


* **Process**
  1. Mix everything in a bowl. Then, add enough water to form a batter (a few tablespoons). Let it rest in the fridge at least 5 minutes (preferably overnight)
  2. Take it out of the fridge and add some more water if needed, to obtain a pretty dense batter.
  3. In a pan, put a teaspoon of butter over medium heat. Once it's hot, add the batter and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side.
   - _When I flip them the first time, I like to put some dark chocolate on top so it melts while it cooks!._

Serve with chocolate sauce, honey, or eat them plain!

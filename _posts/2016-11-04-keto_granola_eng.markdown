This is my go-to keto breakfast with some coconut milk or greek yogurt, and it is also great when I am travelling (I just ask for some whole-fat yogurt and add my granola right there!). It is more of a guideline to make your own keto-fied granola, a low carb and extra crunchy cereal that you can customize to your own taste. 


<ul>
  <li>3/4 cup (105 g) of hemp hearts or seeds</li>
  <li>1,5 cups of nuts of choice; I use 1 cup of almonds and 1/2 cup of hazelnuts</li>
  <li>1/4 cup pepitas (30g)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup cocoa nibs (40g)</li>
  <li>4 tbsp (12 g) of chopped dried cranberries</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
  <li>30 g extra virgin coconut oil</li>
  <li>Sweetener to taste - 2-3 tbsp erythritol</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Toast the nuts (unless you buy them toasted like i do).
  2. Mix all the dry ingredients. 
  3. Mix the sweetener with the melted oil, than pour over the dry ingredients and mix well. 
  4. Let it set in the fridge. Then, take out and break it into smaller chunks. 
  5. Keep in the fridge until consumed. It lasts up to 2 weeks.

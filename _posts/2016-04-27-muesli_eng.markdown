So this is not really a recipe... But I love to have it for breakfast, and it is so handy and so delicious and so filling that I thought I would share it! For seeds you can substitute for whichever you want, to have 1/2 cup of seeds in total.

I personally love this with yoghurt or with applesauce, but anything goes!



<ul>
  <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of raisins or dried cranberries (or more, to taste; you can chop them if you want)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of mixed sesame, flax, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, buckwheat</li>
</ul>



* **Process**
  1. Mix everything and put it in a jar. 
  2. Have a delicious breakfast!

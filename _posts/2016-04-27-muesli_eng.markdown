So this is not really a recipe... But I love to have it for breakfast, and it is so handy and so delicious and so filling that I thought I would share it! 

I personally love this with yoghurt or with applesauce, but anything goes!



* **Ingredients**
  - 1 cup rolled oats
  - 1/4 cup of raisins or dried cranberries (or more, to taste; you can chop them if you want)
  - 1/2 cup of whatever seeds you like. I recommend: sesame, flax, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, buckwheat

  1. Mix everything and put it in a jar. 
  2. Have a delicious breakfast!

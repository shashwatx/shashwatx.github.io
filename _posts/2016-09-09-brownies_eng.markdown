I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I try to bake sugar-free and no carb goods these days. And while experimenting, sometimes things work out :)

I love this recipe because it is easy, tasty, and it can be made in the microwave (I hate turning on the oven in summer!). It makes for quite fudgy and chocolate-y brownies, very low-carb, as well as dairy and gluten-free. And I love the crunch from the walnuts :) 

For vegans or those who don't eat eggs, you can probably use a flax egg instead (1 tbsp flax meal with 2 tbsp of water) and add some psyllium husk powder (otherwise, the coconut flour with the flax might not form a proper batter).

The final flavor might change slightly depending on the protein powder you use, but if you like how your protein powder tastes, you will love these!


<ul>
  <li>30 g coconut flour (1/4 cup)</li>
  <li>45 g of your favorite chocolate-flavored protein powder</li>
  <li>15 g cocoa powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp of coffee granules, or cinnamon</li>
  <li>Optional: stevia or erythritol; I recommend trying the batter and adjusting to taste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup coconut oil (you can use butter instead)</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>Vanilla extract</li>
  <li>30 g chopped walnuts (optional, but... why wouldn't you use them!?)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup of water (to start with; you will have to add more later)</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl (first 7 ingredients) and the wet ingredients in a different one (all the others). Leave the walnuts on the side for now.
  2. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix. Then, add water little by little to adjust the texture, until you get a batter similar to the one for a spongecake. You will probably need 1/2 extra cup of water.
  3. Add the chopped walnuts into your batter and mix.
  4. Pour the batter into a greased baking mold.
  5. Bake at 180C for 25 minutes or in the microwave at 800W for about 4 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. The microwave cooking time varies a lot from one microwave to another, so keep a close eye on it to avoid overcooking and ending up with hard, dry brownies.

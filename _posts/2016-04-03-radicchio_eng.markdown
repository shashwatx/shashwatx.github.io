Today I am having my older sister, Blanca, as a contributing guest for the website. I will let her explain the recipe she made! 


_Risotto, along with pizza, pasta and ice-cream (gelatto), is one of the most popular foods in Italy. And just like those ones, there are a million ways to make risotto. In this case, we are using radicchio and scamorza affumicata._

_First of all, what is radicchio? It is an italian vegetable. It looks like a reddish, spherical salad. But what matters most is its unforgettable flavour: veeeeery bitter! (maybe too much). It is not eaten raw because of this; but when cooked it becomes less bitter, slightly sweet, and gets a nice texture, so it is used in many italian dishes._

_On the other hand, what about scamorza affumicata? Scamorza is a pretty popular italian cheese that is normally soft and white; however, in this case, we will be using scamorza affumicata, which is smoked scamorza. This type of cheese is golden colour and with a very characteristic flavor. Not only is it delicious, but it melts really nicely and forms the most perfect cheese strings, without releasing any water like other cheeses, such as mozzarella._

_This rescipe, "risotto con radicchio e scamorza affumicata", is a genuine italian recipe with genuine italian ingredients. It takes quite a while to make, yes; but the best things always do, and it is worth it! If you have the ingredients, you have to give it a go._


* **Ingredients**, 
  * 1/2 medium sized onion or 1/4 big onion, chopped
  * 1 cup risotto rice (or a bit less, depending on the number of people eating; we used 3/4 cup for 4 people)
  * Same volume of rice, for white wine
  * 1/4 of radicchio, chopped in strips
  * 100-150 g Scamorza Affumicata cheese (or to taste)
  * Aprox. 1L vegetable stock
  * Salt
  * 1 tablespoon of olive oil
  * 1-2 teaspoons of butter (or some more oil)


* **Process**
  1. Put the onion with the oil on a pan to soften on medium-low heat.
  2. Meanwhile, in a casserole over medium-high heat, bring the stock to a boil. Once it is boiling, add a handful of radicchio and let it boil in the stock for about 5 minutes, so it releases some color; afterwards, scoop it out, toss it, and substitute it for a fresh handful of radicchio. Keep doing this. The stock should be boiling constantly. Once we are down to the last handful, cook it in the boiling stock but don't toss it; instead, add it to the final risotto. 
   - We will have to keep doing this while the other part of the risotto gets cooked. This way, the radicchio doesn't overcook, which would lead to it turning black.
  3. Once the onion is soft, add the raw rice to the pan. Toast it for a couple of minutes, and then add the wine. From now on, it is stirring time! Do not dare stop stirring! Be patient and pray your arm won't hurt tomorrow.
  4. Once all the wine has been absorbed, add the stock progressively, a little bit at a time (about 1/4 cup), stirring, and allowing the rice to absorb all the liquid before adding any more.  The rice should never be left without liquid.
   - _If you start running out of stock, you can add some water to the casserole with the stock._
  5. Once the rice is almost soft, add the stock with that last handfull of radicchio that we had saved. 
  6. When the rice is soft and smooth, turn the heat down to low, add the cubed cheese and mix around. Once it is melted, take the pan off the stove and add the butter, and mix well.

Serve it straight out of the pan and enjoy those cheese threads!

My family has never been very fond of tofu. I tried making soups and stir fries, but it seemed like I never managed to make something they actually enjoyed... until this! A very tasty dish, sweet and sour, with the orange zest to make it extra fragrant, even my father had a second serving! 

I didn't make mine very sweet, but perhaps you could use up to a whole tablespoon of honey, and maybe add some chili if you're into it - let me know if you do!

* **Ingredients**, _serves 3_
  * 250 g firm tofu, cubed
  * 1.5 purple onions, very finely chopped
  * _Optional: 1 star anise_
  * 1 tsp garlic paste
  * The juice and zest of one orange (about 1/2 cup of juice) 
  * _Optional: 1-2 tbsp lemon juice, or to taste_
  * 1/2-1 tbsp soy sauce
  * 1/2-1 tbsp honey
  * 1 tsp cornstarch
  * 1/2 tbsp sesame seeds
  * Salt, black pepper
  * 1-2 scallions, to garnish
  * _Optional: fresh coriander, to garnish_

* **Process**
  1. In a non-stick pan, pour 1/2 tbsp of vegetable oil and stir fry the tofu to brown it on medium-high heat. Then, take out of the pan and leave on the side. 
  2. In the same pan over medium heat, add some more oil (1/2-1 tbsp) and then add the onion, star anise and garlic, with a pinch of salt and some black pepper. 
  3. Meanwhile, in a glass, mix all the liquids for the sauce with the cornstarch.
  4. After 5-10 minutes, when the onions are very tender, add the tofu, the sesame seeds and the sauce. Put the heat on low and let it cook together for about 5 minutes for the flavours to infuse. If the sauce evaporates too much, add a spash of water. 
  5. Turn off the heat, garnish and serve.

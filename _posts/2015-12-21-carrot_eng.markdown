* **Ingredients**, _for 3 people_
  * 4-5 big and fairly straight carrots (they are easier to spiralize)
  * 250 g firm tofu
  * Nuts (raw or toasted), about 2 tbsp: cashew nuts, pistachios or peanuts.
  * 2 tsp sesame oil _(can be subbed for oil+sesame seeds, but the flavour won't be as good!)
  * 2 cloves of garlic (1 tsp garlic paste)
  * 1 tsp ginger
  * Green chili verde, to taste
  * _Optional: 1/2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce_
  * 2 tbsp soy sauce (or more, to taste)
  * _Optional, to serve: lemon, fresh coriander._
  * Freshly fround black pepper.

* **Process**
  1. In a pan, pour the sesame oil and add the tofu, garlic, ginger and chili.
  * _If using normal oil and sesame seeds, let them toast in the oil a little._
  * _If using raw nuts, add them before the tofu to allow them to get slightly fried and tasty._
  2. Once the tofu is golden, add the spiralized carrots and mix.
  3. Pour the worcestershire and soy sauce and add some black pepper. 
  4. After abouut 4-5 minutes, the carrot should be done (it should still have some bite to it). Turn off the stove. 
  5. Add the nuts if you are using them toasted, the fresh coriander, and serve.

Serve with fresh coriander and lemon juice. 

**_I have not added 'salt' in the list of ingredients on purpose, since regular soy sauce and worcestershire sauce are already so salty! However, if you are using low sodium salt, you may need to add some to taste._**

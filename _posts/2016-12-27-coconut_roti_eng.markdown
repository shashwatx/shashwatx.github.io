If you miss eating fajitas, or having curry with chapati... this recipe is for you! You will get really soft tortillas/chapati, with a light coconut flavour, that pairs well both with meats and veggies :) 

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (60g) coconut flour</li>
  <li>2 tbsp (16 g) psyllium husk powder</li>
  <li>1/3 tsp salt (omit if using stock)</li>
  <li>1 cup of water or stock</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60g) butter or coconut oil</li>
  <li>Optional: spices to taste (I like to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder)</li>
  <li>5 tsp oil, for cooking</li>
</ul>

* **Process**
  1. Melt the butter or coconut oil. Mix separately the coconut flour, psyllium husk powder, spices and salt, then incorporate the butter.
  2. Add the water or stock, hot (almost boiling). Incorporate and mix until you have a sticky dough.  
  3. Now you have to act fast or else the dough will dry out: divide it into four balls. Knead each one a bit, then put in between two pieces of plastic wrap, and form a disk using a rolling pin or flattening it with a tray; it should be 2-3 mm thick. Then take something round (like the lid of a pan) and use it to cut the roti.
  4. Proceed this way for four tortillas. For the fifth one, use the remaining pieces you cut out of the others. If you prefer, you can just divide the dough in five and make 5 roti from the beginning, without cutting them out (although they won't be as round).
  5. Put a teaspoon of oil in a pan over high heat. Fry the roti about 2 minutes per side until golden.
  6. Keep in a cloth so they remain soft until you eat them, or let them cool down and freeze individually, separated by some parchment paper.

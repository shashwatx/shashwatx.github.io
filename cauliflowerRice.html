<p>This can be used to substitute couscous or rice as a sidedish, as well as in some recipes. I usually either make it in the microwave with some salt, or stir fry it with a bit of oil. I will post some of the things I like to make, but would love to hear your ideas!</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cauliflower, fresh, cut into florets, clean and dry</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If using a <strong>foodprocessor</strong>: rinse the cauliflower florets and, once dry, introduce in the processor (2-3 batches per cauliflower) and process until you get a rice or couscous consistency, abouy 30-60 seconds.</li>
  <li>If using a <strong>mixer</strong>: rinse the cauliflower and introduce in batches in the standing mixer with some water and mix; once acquired the desired texture, drain.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If using a <strong>grater</strong>: rince the cauliflower properly and grate patiently.</p>

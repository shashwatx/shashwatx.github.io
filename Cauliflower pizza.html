A good way of sneaking some vegetables inside of the pizza… It’s very hard to tell the crust is made of cauliflower!</p>

<p>And it’s a great way of having a low-carb, high-fiber dinner.</p>

<p>Don’t be skeptical and give it a try. It is delicious!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>, <em>for 2 medium-sized pizzas</em>
    <ul>
      <li>1 big cauliflower processed into cauliflower rice, like I did <a href="http://maria.recipes/cauliflowerRice/">here</a></li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/4-1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
      <li><em>This may seem like a lot, but take into account that parmesan occupies a lot of volume. Plus, my version has less cheese than others I have seen online!</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the cauliflower rice in two batches in the microwave for 5 minutes. Afterwards, put all the cooked cauliflower into a clean teatowel, fold it and squeeze as much water as you can. If your arms are starting to hurt, you are doing it right. You should spend 5 or 10 minutes doing this, so the final result has good consistency.</li>
      <li>Once squeezed properly, mix all the ingredients and preheat your oven to 180C</li>
      <li>Poner la masa sobre un papel de horno en una bandeja de horno y darle forma con las manos.
        <ul>
          <li><em>The thickness depends on your taste, but it should be even. For pizza I make it 0.3 cm thick, but you can also make tortillas making it very thin, and later on use them for wraps.</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bake until golden. It is a good idea to put it on the lower part of the oven for the last couple of minutes so that the base doesn’t end up soggy.</li>
      <li>Take out of the oven, put the toppings you like, bake it for a couple more minutes so the cheese melts, and… <em>voilà!</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
